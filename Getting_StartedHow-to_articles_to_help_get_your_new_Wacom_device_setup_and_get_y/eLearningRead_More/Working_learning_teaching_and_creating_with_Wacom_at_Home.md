# Working, learning, teaching and creating with Wacom at Home

Covid-19 has put many of us in a new and unusual situation. We are challenged to adjust to changing rules and develop new habits to prevent us and others from harm. These measures are affecting our daily lives and raise many questions around work and school. Many companies encourage employees to work from home. Schools are closed, challenging teachers and students to find new ways to teach or learn from home. And creative studios are ramping up remote working to secure their production pipelines under tight deadlines.

In the past few weeks, we have received many questions around working, learning, teaching and creating from home. We decided to collect all the information we have around some of the most pressing questions and share them here with you. And while many people are new to this situation, there is also a big group of creative freelancers, who are very experienced in working from home and happy to share some practical advice.Using Wacom products for Education and Remote Work.
