# How do you whiteboard digitally with Wacom?

Microsoft Teams


Microsoft Teams requires users to add a plug in to the platform. Here at Wacom, we’re using the InVision plug in. You need to sign up for InVision to add the plug in to your various chats, groups or meetings, but once you do all of the people within the chat can white board together at once. You can do some sketch noting, or visual thinking while others expand on your ideas.



*Select the InVision app.



*Now you’re ready to draw with your team.
Zoom


Zoom includes a whiteboard feature right out of the box, but it’s a bit tricky to find. Here are instructions on how to access it.


1. When you are in a meeting, click on the share icon in the controls. It’s right in the middle in-between “Manage Participants” and “Chat.”



2. A dialog box will open up. Select the option that says “whiteboard.”



Now you can brainstorm on your very own whiteboard. Don’t worry about losing a great idea – there’s an option in the bottom right corner that allows you to open a new whiteboard.
