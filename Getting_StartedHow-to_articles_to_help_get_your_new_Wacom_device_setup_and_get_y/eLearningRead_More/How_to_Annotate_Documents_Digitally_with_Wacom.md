# How to Annotate Documents Digitally with Wacom.

In Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint, head over to the Draw tab and simply pick your pen. Then start marking up the doc. Both programs also allow you to use Windows Ink to create math equations using a pen instead of a mouse or keyboard and in Word, you can embed a drawing canvas right into your Word doc. Save your doc, and you ink is saved too.

Which Wacom products are best for annotation?


For those who want to write on screen, the Wacom One is the best pick. It’s designed to feel good – the screen isn’t cold or sticky or smudgy like other tablets – and the pen is ergonomically design thanks to 30 years of researching the way artists hold their pencils and paints. And it’s also a great choice for students who have a lot of math homework, or who want to continue to develop their art.


For those who want the same ergonomic benefits and more customizable buttons, the Wacom Intuos is a great choice. This one comes with three free pieces of drawing software and is light and small so you can throw it in a drawer when the home office needs to transition back to the dining room table.
