# How to Work From Home When You’re Organized…Or Not

Here at Wacom, we have a band of professional artists who come with us to events and tradeshows and offer their expert ideas and insights in using Wacom products for their art. TheOneWithBear (aka Sarajean) is one of our traveling crew and she’s an expert in many things: Clip Studio Paint, Wacom, gaming, and consuming gigantic burritos at midnight. (It’s this last quality we most admire.)

After 10 years as a professional artist, we knew she would have a lot to say about working from home. She kindly put together this video with her tips for working from home. And like a true pro, she offers tips for those who love to follow the rules…and a more realistic look at life when you’re working from home.

Tech she uses:
Wacom One
Wacom Cintiq Pro 24
Clip Studio Paint


You can catch her streaming on Twitch and see her work on Instagram.
