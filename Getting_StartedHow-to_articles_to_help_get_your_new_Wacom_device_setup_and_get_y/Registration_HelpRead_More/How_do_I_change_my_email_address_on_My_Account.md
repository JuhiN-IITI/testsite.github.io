# How do I change my email address on My Account?

As of September 2025, for security reasons, email addresses can no longer be changed through "My Account". You will need to follow the instructions below to update the email address. Note: Product registration does not affect the operation of your pen tablet.


First, create a new Wacom ID with the new email address you want to use.


Next, create a ticket with Wacom Support, by using the create a ticket option below. Please make sure to include your current/older Wacom ID (email address) in the request.


 


Also note the following before creating a new Wacom ID:

If you have registered your product: If you have a registered product on your account, please check the Wacom Product OS Compatibility List to see if your product is a supported or discontinued product. 

Go to the Wacom Driver downloads page here. Select the "Release Notes" button and then click "Compatible Products" to see the list of current supported devices. 


If your product is a supported product , we will confirm whether your product registration can be transferred. Please note that even if your product registration can be transferred, product transfer may not be possible if the software is no longer available, such as an older product. Also, a license key (activation code) can only be used once under the license agreement.
As stated on this bundled software introduction page, the software content and availability period may change without notice.For discontinued products: Due to the end of product support and the end of bonus software, we will provide you with previously issued keys, etc., as necessary.
If you have a purchase history from the Wacom Store , or if you purchased a product while logged in to the Wacom Store , your purchase history will not be carried over. 
Please keep your purchase history (order number, receipt, and other purchase information) safe for warranty verification at the time of repair. Wacom will verify warranty status before offering a repair..
Please note that we do not offer data transfer services for various web services/apps that use your Wacom ID, so we recommend keeping your original data on hand.
If you wish to delete your old Wacom ID after creating a new one, please note let us know during your change request.
