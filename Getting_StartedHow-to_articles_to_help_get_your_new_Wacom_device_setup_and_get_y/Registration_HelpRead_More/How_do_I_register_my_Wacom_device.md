Windows 7 Users


Microsoft has discontinued support for Windows 7 users and automatic updates. This can cause some computers to be missing an update that is required for the automatic registration process through the Wacom Center not to work correctly. If you are unable to register on Windows 7, make sure you have the latest update as described here. If you have the latest TLS protocol, and the issue continues, please contact Wacom support. 


If you have already completed the setup steps shown above, you will see a blue banner when you select your tablet in the Wacom Center. Click the link to automatically register your tablet.
