# I have already signed up with Wacom for specific services, do I need to create a new Wacom ID?

In principle, you need only one Wacom ID.
 If you are already a Wacom customer there is a chance you have already signed up for various services individually such as Inkspace ID, and so on (*).
 As of March 2018, Wacom will unite your email-based IDs into a single Wacom ID that serves as single sign-in to all your accounts. Since this is a gradual transition, your currently existing IDs might stay valid for a while after March. In this case, your currently existing IDs may not be accepted in other platforms, for example newly created software redemption site. Â 
 When your current IDs no longer function, we advise you to create a new Wacom ID for complete access.
 In case you have questions or issues while creating or using your Wacom ID, please contact us using the contact support button at the bottom of this page.
 (*) Current services and platforms are: Wacom eStore, Wacom Inkspace, Bamboo Paper, Development Relations. This list is not exhaustive and we add new services on on-going basis. Variations per country or region may apply.
