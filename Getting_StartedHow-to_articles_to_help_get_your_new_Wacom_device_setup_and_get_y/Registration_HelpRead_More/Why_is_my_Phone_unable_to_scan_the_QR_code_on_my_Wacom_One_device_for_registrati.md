# Why is my Phone unable to scan the QR code on my Wacom One device for registration?

In some cases, a phone may have trouble scanning the QR code on the back of the Wacom One, when following the Wacom ID (browser-based) registration process. We have found that some phones will default to a wide-angle lens making it difficult to read the QR code. If your phone has more than 1 camera, look for and choose a different camera selection button below the scanning window and try again.


Here are some other ways to register your Wacom One.


Launch your camera app directly. It will default to whatever focal length is required to read the code. Once you have captured the QR code please sigh into Wacom ID and proceed with the registration process.


Connect your Wacom One to a PC or Mac and proceed with the registration process via the Wacom Center.
