# What are the benefits of my Wacom ID?

When you have created a Wacom ID you can:

Fast and easy access to our services with a single Wacom ID. You don’t need to manage multiple IDs for different purposes including downloading software, making purchases on our eStore, and signing-up for content.
One unique identifier. This allows our customer care teams to give you the best possible service, provide relevant answers to your questions and effective solutions to your issues. 
Gain authorization to download free software for those products Wacom bundles with free software.
Information about promotions, as well as offers from the Wacom eStore.
Access to tutorials, tips and tricks or other content from people from the creative community that Wacom partners with. This is also why we sometimes ask you what your area of interest is or how you work creatively. As we get to know you better, what we offer will fit your specific interests.
Subscribe to our regular newsletter to keep you informed about news and trends in the creative arena.
