# Corel Painter Essentials 5 serial code says its invalid, what do I do?

When installing Corel Painter Essentials 5, the program will ask for a serial code to active. This code is located next to the download button in the “My Library” section of your Wacom account. To access this section, please log into your account's my library section here.


Due to the license agreements of the free bundled application, the installation is for one computer, and one OS only. If you have not previously installed the application and if you are using the code located under my library and the issue continues, please contact Wacom support.
