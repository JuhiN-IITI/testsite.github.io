# For the DTU-1031X, DTU-1141 and DTU-1141B, do both USB-A connectors on the USB Y-cable need to be plugged in to the PC?

We highly recommended that both USB-A connectors are plugged into the PC. On some systems, plugging just the main USB-A connector into the PC may be sufficient. However, many PCs and work stations have inconsistent current supplied to individual USB ports, so connecting both USB-A connectors helps ensure sufficient power.
