# How do Wacom pen displays connect to the PC?

Wacom's DTU-1031X/DTU-1031X/DTU-1031AX and DTU-1141/DTU-1141B connect to the PC with a single USB cable that provides power and transmits data. Wacom's DTK-1660E and DTK-2451/DTH-2452 utilize a proprietary three-in-one cable for simple installation. Wacom’s DTC121/DTC121W5Z and DTH134/DTH134W5Z connect to the PC with a single USB-C cable, and may require an additional USB-C cable & power adapter (depending on the power output of the PC’s USB-C port).
