# Why is a wide viewing angle important?

The wide viewing angle is especially important for point-of-sale and built-in use. It ensures that the customer can read the screen content, both signature ink as well as text, buttons, logos and advertising messages, regardless of the stature, posture, position, or handedness of the user.
