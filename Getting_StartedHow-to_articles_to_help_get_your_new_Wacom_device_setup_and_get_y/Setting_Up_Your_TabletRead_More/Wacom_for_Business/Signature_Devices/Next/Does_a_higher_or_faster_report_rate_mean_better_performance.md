# Does a higher, or faster, report rate mean better performance?

Not necessarily. It is the combination of sensor resolution and report rate that result in the accuracy of pen movement. A faster report rate, combined with low sensor resolution can yield poor accuracy, as many datapoints will be duplicates, and the number of inaccurate data points will be magnified. Wacom's 200 points per second data rate, combined with 2540 lines per inch of resolution, results in an optimum capture of high-quality signature data.
