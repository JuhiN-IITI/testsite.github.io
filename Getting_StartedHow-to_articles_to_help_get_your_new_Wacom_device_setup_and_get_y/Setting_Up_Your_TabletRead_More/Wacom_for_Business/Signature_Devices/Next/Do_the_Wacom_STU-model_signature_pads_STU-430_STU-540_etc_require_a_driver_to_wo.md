# Do the Wacom STU-model signature pads (STU-430, STU-540, etc.) require a driver to work?

The STU model signature tablets do not require a driver, though the Wacom STU Driver is recommended if using a Windows 10 system for optimal performance. The STU-530 uses a light driver to support bulk transfer. The driver is included in the SDK, or can be obtained here - https://developer-support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/9354527258007-STU-Driver-Installation


Keep in mind the STU-model signature pads are not 'plug-and-play' - they require software with components derived from our related SDKs to initiate the signature signing ceremony with the device such as our sign pro PDF application, third-party integrations or your own solution.Â
