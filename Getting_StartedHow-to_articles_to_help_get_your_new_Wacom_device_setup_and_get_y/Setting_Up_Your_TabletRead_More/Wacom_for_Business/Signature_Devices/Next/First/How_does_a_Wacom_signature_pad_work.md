# How does a Wacom signature pad work?

A Wacom signature pad consists of a special sensor panel fitted underneath an LCD display, as well as a wireless and battery-free signature pen. The handwritten signature is read using Wacom’s patented electromagnetic resonance (EMR) technology. When the user moves the pen across the sensor panel, EMR scans the biometric parameters of the signature in real time and sends this data to the computer, which can then be processed by software applications or software components (SDK) which feed this signature data to an application. To allow a visual inspection of the signature, the digital ink is displayed on the LCD display as it is created from the pen movement over the sensor. The behaviour of Wacom’s digital ink is designed to mimic the pen on paper experience.
