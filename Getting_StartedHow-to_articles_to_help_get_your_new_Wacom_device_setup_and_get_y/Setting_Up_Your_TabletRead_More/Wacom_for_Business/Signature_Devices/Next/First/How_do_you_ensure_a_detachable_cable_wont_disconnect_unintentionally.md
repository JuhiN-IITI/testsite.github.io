# How do you ensure a detachable cable wonâ€™t disconnect unintentionally?

With the DTU-1031X, DTU-1141 and DTH-1152 we have a physical clip that secures, or locks the USB cable in place. The USB cable attachment secures the USB connector in the USB socket. The STU-430, STU-430V and STU-530 devices have a detachable USB cable lock that doubles as a pen holder.
