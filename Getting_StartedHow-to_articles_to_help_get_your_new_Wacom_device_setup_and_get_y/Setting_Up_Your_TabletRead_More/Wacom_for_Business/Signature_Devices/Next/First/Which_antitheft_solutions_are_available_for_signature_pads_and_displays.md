# Which antitheft solutions are available for signature pads and displays?

All Wacom devices come with a security lock slot which can be utilized to secure the device. In addition, any device larger than 10" comes with pre-drilled VESA mounts which can be used to attach the device to a desk or articulating arm. The exact VESA mount size will vary by display model. Older pads can be secured with an antitheft cord as well.
