# What sensor technologies are available in signature pads in general?

There are three sensor technologies commonly available: electro-magnetic, capacitive and resistive. Capacitive and electro-magnetic technology measure the change in the electric field of the sensor. Capacitive technologies are often used in touch screens, which may be accidentally activated by your finger or hand. Resistive technology focuses on the electric resistance caused by an object touching a flexible screen surface. This type of touchscreen technology is prone to accidental activation and surface scratches which impacts the user experience.


Wacom uses patented electro-magnetic resonance technology, which is powered wirelessly from the sensor under the LCD. This allows the electronic pen to function without any wires or cords to carry electrical signals. Electric wires are prone to twisting and breaking with normal use, which limits their reliability in use. Wacom signature pads and pen displays are extremely durable, reliable, and even capture the movements of the pen above the surface of the screen for even greater biometric performance.
