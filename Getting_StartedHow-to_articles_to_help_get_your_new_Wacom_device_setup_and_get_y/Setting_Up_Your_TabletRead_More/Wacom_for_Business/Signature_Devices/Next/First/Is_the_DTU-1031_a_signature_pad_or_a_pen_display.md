# Is the DTU-1031 a signature pad or a pen display?

It is both. The DTU-1031 functions as a pen display, which means that once the drivers are installed, the pen controls the cursor in any application, including left click, double click, and right click. The Wacom Signature SDK, and e-Signature software from Wacom, SoftPro, and Xyzmo also recognize the DTU-1031 for signature capture.
