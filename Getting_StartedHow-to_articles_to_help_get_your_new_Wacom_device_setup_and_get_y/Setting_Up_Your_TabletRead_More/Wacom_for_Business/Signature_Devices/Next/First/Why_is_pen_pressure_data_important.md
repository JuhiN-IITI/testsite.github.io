# Why is pen pressure data important?

The pen pressure data is used to generate an accurate rendering of the digital ink on the computer screen that gives the appearance of ink on paper. In addition, pen pressure data can also be recorded for forensic purposes, as each individual has a pattern for how hard or how lightly they press the pen to the screen as they sign. Wacom's sign pro PDF software renders pressure sensitive signatures on the screen, and the capability to add pressure sensitive rendering to your application is included in Wacom's WILL SDK for signature.
 Pen-pressure affects the thickness of the line when writing on paper. This variation is an important signature characteristic in some cultures, especially China, and the acceptance of electronic signatures would be compromised if they did not appear to behave in a similar way. It is therefore important for pressure to be recorded and indicated visually for both forensic and cultural reasons.
