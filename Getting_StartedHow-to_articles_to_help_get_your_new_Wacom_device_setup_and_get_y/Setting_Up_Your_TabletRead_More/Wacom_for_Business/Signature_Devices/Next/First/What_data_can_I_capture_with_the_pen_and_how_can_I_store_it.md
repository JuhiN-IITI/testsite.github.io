# What data can I capture with the pen and how can I store it?

Tilt angle*, time, pressure, X location, and Y location can be captured. It can be embedded in the signature image (using steganography), saved as a base 64 string, or stored in a proprietary FSS format. *Tilt angle is captured with supported devices.
