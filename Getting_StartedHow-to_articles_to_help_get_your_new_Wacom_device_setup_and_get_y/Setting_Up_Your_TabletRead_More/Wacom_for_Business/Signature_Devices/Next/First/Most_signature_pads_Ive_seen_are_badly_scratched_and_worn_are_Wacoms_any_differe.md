# Most signature pads I’ve seen are badly scratched and worn, are Wacom’s any different?

Wacom's signature pads and pen displays are designed with a protective surface of scratch resistant tempered glass. This glass surface is much harder than the plastic material of the pen nib, so the nib wears, not the screen surface. This glass surface withstands hundreds of thousands of signatures with no visible wear. Many other signature pads use a plastic signing surface, which will scratch and deteriorate with normal use.
