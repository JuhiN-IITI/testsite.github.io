# Why is ergonomic design important for a signature device?

It is important for the customer to be comfortable when using the signature device. If he or she signs and doesn't have a close-to-natural feeling, the overall acceptance will be low. From a compliance perspective, if a device doesn't have an ergonomic design, it will not be able to capture a natural biometric signature. Thus, this signature will legally not be accepted as it cannot be compared with other reference signature of the signee.
 Wacom's signature pads can be used for right-handed as well as left-handed people. There is no limitation from this perspective.
