# Could digital pens be replaced by touchscreens?

Touch screen operation is suitable for moving icons and selecting menu options but lacks the precision or responsiveness required for the production of content, such as drawing and note taking. In contrast, a digital pen can accommodate any touchscreen operation and has additional functionality which comes to life when creating content. All functions of pen and touchscreens are complementary and the possibility that touch might replace digital pens is extremely low.
