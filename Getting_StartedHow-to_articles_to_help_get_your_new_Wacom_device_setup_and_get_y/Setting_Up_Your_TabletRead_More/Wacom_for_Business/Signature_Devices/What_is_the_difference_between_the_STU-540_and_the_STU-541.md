# What is the difference between the STU-540 and the STU-541?

The STU-540 and STU-541 differ in three ways: 1) They use different encryption types from one another; 2) The STU-540 supports a virtual COM Port (VCP) mode; and 3) The STU-540 can support a serial (RS-232) connection via a separate accessory kit.
