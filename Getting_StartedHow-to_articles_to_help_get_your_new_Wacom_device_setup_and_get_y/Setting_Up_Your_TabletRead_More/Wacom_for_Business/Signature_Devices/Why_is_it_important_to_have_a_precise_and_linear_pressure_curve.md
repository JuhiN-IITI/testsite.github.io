# Why is it important to have a precise and linear pressure curve?

Forensic experts require precise information on the relation of force applied and pressure levels. Only with a linear pressure curve can signature devices (can) differentiate between various pressure levels and provide an appropriate resolution rate.


A reliable signature capture device has to record the same pressure levels in all segments of the capturing area with the same precision when the same force is being applied. When capturing signatures on different tablets of the same type from the same manufacturer, the signal data must not exceed a certain tolerance level, otherwise an analysis or verification would have to be adjusted to each device.
WacomÂ´s signature pads fulfill both requirements: a) a linear pressure curve and b) the same precision and pressure levels in all segments of the capturing area.
