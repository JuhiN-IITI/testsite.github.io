# Why donâ€™t other manufacturers use glass as surface material?

Our EMR technology transmits power and data directly through the glass surface and the LCD itself. Other technologies, both capacitive and resistive, need a flexible surface with the sensor directly on the surface. Other vendors have to use softer surface materials because they measure the physical pressure levels directly on the surface with a mechanical sensor mounted on top of the display. These materials are susceptible to scratches during normal use.
