# Why don’t other manufacturers use glass as surface material?

Our EMR technology transmits power and data directly through the glass surface and the LCD itself. Other technologies, both capacitive and resistive, need a flexible surface with the sensor directly on the surface. Other vendors have to use softer surface materials because they measure the physical pressure levels directly on the surface with a mechanical sensor mounted on top of the display. These materials are susceptible to scratches during normal use.
