# Why do you have different display types in signature devices?

Wacom has developed a range of displays in various sizes in order to accommodate the wide range of workflows where document review and signature capture are required. When trying to decide between models, we recommend considering the space you have available for the display, the ambient lighting conditions, whether the device needs to be mobile, and whether or not you plan to show color images or documents.
