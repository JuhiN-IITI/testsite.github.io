# Is scanning a paper signature the same as an electronic handwritten signature?

No. A static image, or a photo of a signature can help make signature information more accessible, but it does not provide as many benefits as capturing the signature directly in an electronic form without printing. Document scanners use CCD sensors to read the image of a handwritten signature as color and brightness information of individual pixels. The signature is recorded as static image data only. The appearance of a signature alone is not a secure criterion, because the individual dynamic parameters of the signature are missing. Signature pads take security to the next level by analyzing the signature as it is handwritten on a sensor panel using a special pen. In addition to the appearance of the signature, they record biometric parameters such as acceleration, pressure progression and the angle of the pen while signing, thereby producing a kind of a “digital fingerprint”. This fingerprint is as individual and unique as its owner, and together with a digital certificate, is the safest method of reading electronic signatures.
