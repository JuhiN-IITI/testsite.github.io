# Why is a detachable USB cable better than a fixed mounted USB cable?

A detachable USB cable has several advantages:


- Its length can be individually adapted to the needs of the environment the pad is used in. We offer both 3' and 4.5' USB cables. Longer cables can also be purchased from most IT vendors.


- A detachable USB cable allows a free cable conduit.


- If you built the pad into a counter and you need to change a pad, the cable doesn't need to be exchanged. This can save a lot of time in the field.


- If a cable breaks or is defective it can be easily be exchanged without opening the device and sending it back to a repair center.
