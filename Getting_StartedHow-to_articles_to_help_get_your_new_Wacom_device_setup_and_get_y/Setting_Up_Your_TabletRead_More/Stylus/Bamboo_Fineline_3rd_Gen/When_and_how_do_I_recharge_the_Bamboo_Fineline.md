# When and how do I recharge the Bamboo Fineline?

When the battery capacity of the Bamboo Fineline reaches approximately 15%, the LED light begins to blink red and you will need to recharge. Remove the cap at the top end of the stylus. Insert the USB cable (included in the box) and connect it to a computer or USB charger. The LED light will display solid red while charging. Charging is complete when the LED light turns from red to off, after approximately 2 hours.
