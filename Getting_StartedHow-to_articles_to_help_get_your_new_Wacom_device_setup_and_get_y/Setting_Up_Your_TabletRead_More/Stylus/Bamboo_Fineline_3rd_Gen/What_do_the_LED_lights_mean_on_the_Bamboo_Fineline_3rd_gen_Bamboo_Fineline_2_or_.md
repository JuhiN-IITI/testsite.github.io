# What do the LED lights mean on the Bamboo Fineline (3rd gen), Bamboo Fineline 2, or the original Bamboo Stylus Fineline?

The LED lights indicate the status of the Bamboo Fineline, informing about pairing, connecting or a low battery. There are two colorsâ€”blue and red--and the lights can either be solid or blinking.


Here is an overview of what this means in detail:

When you turn the Bamboo Fineline on, a blue LED blinks twice to indicate that the stylus is on.
When you turn the Bamboo Fineline off, a red LED blinks twice to indicate that the stylus is off.
When the battery is low, a red LED will flash.
While charging, a red LED will be on.
Once your stylus is ready, the LED will turn off.
When your stylus blinks blue it is in the process of pairing with an app
When the blue light is on your stylus is paired with an app
