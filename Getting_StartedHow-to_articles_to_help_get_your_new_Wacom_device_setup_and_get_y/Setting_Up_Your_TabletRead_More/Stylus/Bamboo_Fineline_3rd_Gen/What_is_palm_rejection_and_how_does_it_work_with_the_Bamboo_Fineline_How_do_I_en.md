# What is palm rejection and how does it work with the Bamboo Fineline? How do I enable it?

When a display supports pen input and touch, palm rejection allows you to rest your palm comfortably on the iPad screen while using the Bamboo Fineline stylus. Without this feature, your palm would leave stray marks on the digital paper in an app. Please note that this feature requires support by the respective app.
