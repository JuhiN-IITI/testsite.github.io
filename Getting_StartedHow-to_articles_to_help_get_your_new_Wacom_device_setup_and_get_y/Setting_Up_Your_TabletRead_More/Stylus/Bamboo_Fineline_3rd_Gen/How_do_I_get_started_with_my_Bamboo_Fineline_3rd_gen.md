# How do I get started with my Bamboo Fineline (3rd gen)?

First, prepare your smart stylus: Charge your Bamboo Fineline by connecting it to your computer or USB charger, using the cable provided. Your stylus is ready when the LED turns off. The battery charges in about 2 hours.
Turn on your stylus by twisting it. The LED will blink blue for 2 seconds.
Then, prepare your iPad or iPhone: Open the Settings app: 
  
Activate Bluetooth® wireless.
In “General” settings, switch off “Gestures.” If using an iPhone, skip this step.
To use your stylus, you need to: Download a Wacom stylus compatible app and pair it with your stylus. To see a list of compatible apps and pairing videos visit www.wacom.com/finelinego 
Open the app and find the “Settings” menu.
Open the “Settings” menu to enable stylus support. You may need to open a new note or notebook to pair your stylus. Pairing differs by app. Please see the pairing videos at www.wacom.com/finelinego for more information.
 
Press the button on your stylus. The LED starts blinking blue. Pairing is complete when the LED stays on.
Repeat step 3 when pairing with another app for the first time. The location of the “Settings” menu and the precise steps necessary will vary from app to app, so it’s best to follow the instructions in the apps.



Additionally, apps such as Bamboo™ Paper, Noteshelf and Notes Plus support multiple hand positions in order to maximize performance. Please check for this feature when pairing your app. On http://www.wacom.com/finelinego you’ll find videos that show how to set up some of the most popular apps.
