# What can I do with the button on the Bamboo Fineline (3rd gen), Bamboo Fineline 2, or the original Bamboo Stylus Fineline?

In most compatible apps, you can select from a range of time-saving functions that can be assigned to the button. For example, in Bamboo Paper you can choose between "eraser,‚Äù "undo," "redo" and "full screen."
