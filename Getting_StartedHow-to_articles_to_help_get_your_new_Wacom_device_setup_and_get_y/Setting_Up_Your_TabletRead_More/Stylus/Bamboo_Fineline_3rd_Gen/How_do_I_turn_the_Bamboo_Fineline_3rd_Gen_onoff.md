# How do I turn the Bamboo Fineline (3rd Gen) on/off?

Simply twist the barrel of the stylus to turn it on or off. A blue LED light indicates the stylus is on and a red LED light indicates the stylus is off. If the Bamboo Fineline stylus is asleep, touch it to the device screen to turn it on automatically. If you need to pair it with a supporting app, simply press the button. After 10 minutes without use, the Bamboo Fineline turns itself off automatically. If you want to turn it off manually, press and hold the button for 5 seconds. This will also disconnect it from any apps
