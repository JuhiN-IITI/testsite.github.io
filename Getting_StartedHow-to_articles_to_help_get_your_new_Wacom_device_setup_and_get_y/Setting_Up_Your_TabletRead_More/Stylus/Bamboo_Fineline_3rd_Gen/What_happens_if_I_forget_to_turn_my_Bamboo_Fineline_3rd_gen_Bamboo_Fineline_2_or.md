# What happens if I forget to turn my Bamboo Fineline (3rd gen), Bamboo Fineline 2, or the original Bamboo Stylus Fineline off?

The Bamboo Fineline will automatically go into sleep mode after 10-15 seconds, assuming the stylus is not touching your screen. Once in sleep mode, a single full-charge should last approximately 10,000 hours. To wake the Bamboo Fineline from sleep mode, just tap the screen of your device with the tip of the stylus. To ensure optimal battery performance, the stylus must be turned off while it is not in use.
