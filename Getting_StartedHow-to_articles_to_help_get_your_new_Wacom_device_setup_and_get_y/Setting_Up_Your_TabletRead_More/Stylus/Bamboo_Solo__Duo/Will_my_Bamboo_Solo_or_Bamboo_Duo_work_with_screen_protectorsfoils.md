# Will my Bamboo Solo or Bamboo Duo work with screen protectors/foils?

Bamboo Solo and Bamboo Duo each have a highly sensitive pen tip that is designed to respond to a light touch on glass screens. Various screen protection foils are available on the market, differentiated by their thickness and surface treatment. Therefore, you should expect a different stylus-on-screen feeling when using Bamboo Solo or Bamboo Duo with a protective foil on the screen. In most cases, you will find that you need slightly more pressure to operate your stylus. For best results, we recommend using your new stylus without screen protection foil.
