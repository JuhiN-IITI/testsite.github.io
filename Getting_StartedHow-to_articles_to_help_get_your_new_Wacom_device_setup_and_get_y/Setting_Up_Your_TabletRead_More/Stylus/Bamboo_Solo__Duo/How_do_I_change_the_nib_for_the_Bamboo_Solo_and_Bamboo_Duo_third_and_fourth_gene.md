# How do I change the nib for the Bamboo Solo and Bamboo Duo (third and fourth generation)?

If you experience difficulty extracting the nib, please hold the area close to the pen body (bottom of nib where rubber coating is applied), or rotate the pen body to the side while holding the nib with your other hand.
