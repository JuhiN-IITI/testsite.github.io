# Will my Bamboo Solo or Bamboo Duo work on all media tablets and touch-enabled devices?

Bamboo Stylus has been designed to support touch-enabled screens. It supports the native resolution of the individual touch input sensor, which means that the device defines the actual resolution. Although the majority of the latest media tablets and touch enabled devices generally provide a good user experience, it may still differ slightly depending on the hardware design of the device manufacturer. In some cases, you might experience a different response from the touch screen with your stylus than with a finger. The experience of using a stylus is also dependent on the application that you are using.


We recommend using Bamboo Solo or Bamboo Duo with our free Bamboo Paper app in order to achieve the best writing and drawing experience on your touch screen. Bamboo Paper is now available for iOS (iPad), Android and Windows10. In order to guarantee a satisfactory customer experience with a Bamboo Solo and Bamboo Duo on media tablets and touch devices, we have tested the experience of each stylus on selected products.
