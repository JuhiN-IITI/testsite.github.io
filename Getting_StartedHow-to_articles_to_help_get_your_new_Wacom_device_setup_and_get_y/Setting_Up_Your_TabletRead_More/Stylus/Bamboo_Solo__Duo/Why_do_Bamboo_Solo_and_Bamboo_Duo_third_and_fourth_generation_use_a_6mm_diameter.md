# Why do Bamboo Solo and Bamboo Duo (third and fourth generation) use a 6mm diameter nib while the second generation used a 5mm nib?

Since the launch of the Bamboo Stylus products, the range of media tablets has developed, offering a broader set of options today. To support this variety, we have developed the new carbon fiber nib with 6mm diameter: its product design guarantees a fluid writing experience and smooth navigation with most of the tablets available today. Together with the new body design made of aluminum, the Bamboo Stylus (third and fourth generation) provides a precise pen input, resulting in a natural pen experience.
