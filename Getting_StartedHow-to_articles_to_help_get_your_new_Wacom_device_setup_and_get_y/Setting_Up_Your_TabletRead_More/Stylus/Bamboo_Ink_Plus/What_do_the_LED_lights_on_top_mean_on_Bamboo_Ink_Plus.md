# What do the LED lights on top mean on Bamboo Ink Plus?

A Blue LED turns on when you Bamboo Ink Plus is ready for paring. When it is slowly flashing, Bamboo Ink Plus is inside the pairing mode. After your Bamboo Ink Plus is successfully paired with your device, a LED flashes rapidly for 3 seconds. By clicking the top button, Bamboo Ink Plus checks the battery level. When the battery is low, an orange LED will flash 3 times.
