# Is there an On/Off switch in my Bamboo Ink Plus?

Yes. Bamboo Ink Plus power on when you press front side switch for 1 sec and power off when you press it for 5 sec. Also, Bamboo Ink Plus will be activated by a click on the screen. After a tail short period of not being used it goes into sleep mode to save power.
