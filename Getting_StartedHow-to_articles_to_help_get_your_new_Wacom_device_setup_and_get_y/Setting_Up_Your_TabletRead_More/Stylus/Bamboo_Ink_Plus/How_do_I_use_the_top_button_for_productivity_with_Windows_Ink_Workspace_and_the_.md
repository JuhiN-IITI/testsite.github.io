# How do I use the top button for productivity with Windows Ink Workspace and the Bamboo Ink Plus?

To enable this function, you need to pair Bamboo Ink Plus to your device via Bluetooth®. After paring to your device, clicking the button gives you direct access to the apps you want to use and a convenient short cut to the Windows Ink Workspace. You can customize the button from “Windows start menu> Setting > Devices> Pen & Windows Ink”. As a default setting, single click to open Windows Ink Workspace, double click allows you to open Screen Sketch and click and hold to open Sticky Notes Note: if you face any trouble of Bluetooth connection, please update you Windows OS with the latest version and delete “Bamboo Ink Plus” from paring list in your device.
