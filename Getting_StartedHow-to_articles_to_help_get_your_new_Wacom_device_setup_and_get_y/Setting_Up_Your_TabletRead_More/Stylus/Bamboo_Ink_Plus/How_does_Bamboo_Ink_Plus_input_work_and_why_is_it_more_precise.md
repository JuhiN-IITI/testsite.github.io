# How does Bamboo Ink Plus input work and why is it more precise?

With the Bamboo Ink Plus, your lines, letters and characters look the way you intend because the stylus senses the slightest movement of the pen tip (position, speed, direction) and change of applied pressure. It features advanced, active technology that communicates with the sensors on compatible tablets and PCs to detect precise movements of your stylus.
