# What do I need to do when pressing the top button doesn’t launch an app?

Make sure your Bamboo Ink Plus is paired to your device. You can check from the Windows Start menu, select Settings> Devices > Bluetooth®. If pressing the top button still doesn’t launch the app, you might need to update the Windows OS and Wacom Driver with latest version on your device. Please visit support.wacom.com and after you have selected your region, go to the Drivers section and follow the steps to update your driver.
