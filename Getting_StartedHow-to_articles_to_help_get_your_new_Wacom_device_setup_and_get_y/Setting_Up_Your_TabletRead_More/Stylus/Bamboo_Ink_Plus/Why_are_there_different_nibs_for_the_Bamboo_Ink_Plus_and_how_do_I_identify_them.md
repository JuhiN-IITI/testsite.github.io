# Why are there different nibs for the Bamboo Ink Plus and how do I identify them?

To give you the most authentic feel while writing and sketching on screens, you can choose between three kinds of pen nibs. Slide to open the nib kit and choose from left to right: Firm (White), Soft (Gray). or Blue (Blue). The one that comes pre-installed with your Bamboo Ink Plus is a Medium nib. The best thing to do is to try the soft, medium and firm nib in your Bamboo Ink Plus to see which one is most comfortable for you.


Note: On certain devices you may not experience a satisfactory drawing line. In this instance please try the Blue nib from the nib kit
