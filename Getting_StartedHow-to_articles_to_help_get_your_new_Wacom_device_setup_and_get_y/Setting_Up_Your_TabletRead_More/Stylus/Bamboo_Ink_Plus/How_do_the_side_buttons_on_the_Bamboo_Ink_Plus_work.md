# How do the side buttons on the Bamboo Ink Plus work?

The Bamboo Ink Plus has two side buttons on the body of the stylus that will change your compatibility setting mode. By pressing and holding both side buttons at same time for 2 seconds you can change the compatibility mode of your pen. In the process of changing this setting, the LED underneath the side buttons will blink. A single LED blink stand for Wacom AES mode and two blinks changes to Microsoft Pen Protocol. The out of the box setting is set to Microsoft Pen Protocol.


Also side buttons can be used as right click, but default settings may differ depending on your device, please check your device settings.


Note: For the side switches to work properly, know that the pen must be inside of proximity with your tablet. You should be able to tell that you are in proximity by seeing a little circle when you hover the pen over the screen.
