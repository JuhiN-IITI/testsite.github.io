# How do I pair Bamboo Ink Plus with my devices via Bluetooth®?

From the Windows Start menu, select Settings> Devices > Bluetooth® and make sure Bluetooth® is “On“. Hold the top button for 6 seconds then the Blue LED will start blinking. From the list of devices, select “Bamboo Ink Plus“ and click on “Pair“. Your pen is paired and ready to be used.


Note: For the top button to properly work when pairing, your Bamboo Ink Plus must be out of the proximity range of the tablet in use (at least 5 cm/ 2 inches away)
