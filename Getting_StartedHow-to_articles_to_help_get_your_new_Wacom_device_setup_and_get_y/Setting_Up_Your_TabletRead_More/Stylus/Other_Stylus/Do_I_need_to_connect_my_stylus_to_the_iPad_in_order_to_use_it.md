# Do I need to connect my stylus to the iPad in order to use it?

Your stylus will work even when it’s not connected in-app, although it will have an offset of 3-5mm, and pressure sensitivity, palm rejection and the side switch(es) won’t function in unpaired mode. For optimal performance, we recommend the following:

Ensure that your Stylus Fineline or Intuos Creative Stylus 2 is not in sleep mode or disconnected from the app in use.
Press the side-switch on your stylus until the indicator light flashes blue. The LED will light up for two seconds when properly paired.



In many apps, restarting will reengage the Bluetooth connection, although for some apps you may need to visit Settings Menu > Supported Devices to manually reconnect the stylus.
