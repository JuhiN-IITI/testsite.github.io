# Why is there a Bamboo Stylus feel built specifically for the Samsung Galaxy Note?

The geometry of the active feel sensor on the Samsung Galaxy Note causes a clearly perceivable pen position offset when used with the standard Bamboo Stylus feel. To address this incompatibility, we adjusted the integration of our feel IT technology to fit the specific hardware configuration of Samsung Gallery Note devices. The result is a Bamboo Stylus feel with a slightly shorter tip, built specifically to enable optimized writing and drawing on the Samsung Galaxy Note.
