# What are the factors that affect Inkling’s accuracy?

Inkling uses both ultrasonic and infrared technologies that require proper conditions to operate well. The primary factors that can affect its accuracy are:

Line of sight between the pen sensors (located in the pen tip area starting just below the widest point of the pen) and the receiver
Stroke speed
Direct sunlight on the receiver
Position of the receiver
Ultrasonic noise, and other “white” noise at certain frequencies
The smaller the angle between the table and the Inkling, the bigger the offset you’ll see in the recorded file.
Please ensure that the Inkling receiver is properly attached to the paper sheet or notebook; for best results, insert more than one piece of paper into the receiver clip to prevent accidental movement of the receiver.
