# Why doesn’t Sketch Manager detect Sketchbook Pro in the App Store?

The OS X App store contains a version of SketchBook Pro which Sketch Manager unfortunately doesn’t detect, and Wacom is actively working with Apple to solve this issue. As a workaround, simply open the files on the Inkling receiver with Sketchbook to import your files.
