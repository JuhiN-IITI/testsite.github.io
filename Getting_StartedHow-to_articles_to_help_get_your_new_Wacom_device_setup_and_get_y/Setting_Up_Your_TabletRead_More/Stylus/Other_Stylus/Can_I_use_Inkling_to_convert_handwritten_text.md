# Can I use Inkling to convert handwritten text?

You can use the Inkling for writing, however, it canâ€™t be used to convert handwritten texts. This is because Inkling was designed specifically for drawing, giving you the power to transfer your sketches and designs from paper to your computer via graphic design software (such as Photoshop CS5, for example).
