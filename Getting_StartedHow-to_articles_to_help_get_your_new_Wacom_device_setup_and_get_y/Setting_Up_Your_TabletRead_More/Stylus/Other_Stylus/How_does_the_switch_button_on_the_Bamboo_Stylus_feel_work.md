# How does the switch button on the Bamboo Stylus feel work?

The function of your Bamboo Stylus feel’s switch button, located on the side of the pen body, is usually preset by the application you are using. It’s also often possible to customize this function from within the application; to determine if customization is possible, and if so, how it can be implemented, please check the application system software documentation.
