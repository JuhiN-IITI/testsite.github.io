# How do I turn the Bamboo Fineline 2 on/off?

The Bamboo Fineline 2 is switched on automatically when pressure is applied to the pen tip. If you need to pair it with a supporting app, simply press the button. After 10 minutes without use, the Bamboo Fineline 2 turns itself off automatically. If you want to turn it off manually, press and hold the button for 5 seconds. This will also disconnect it from any apps.
