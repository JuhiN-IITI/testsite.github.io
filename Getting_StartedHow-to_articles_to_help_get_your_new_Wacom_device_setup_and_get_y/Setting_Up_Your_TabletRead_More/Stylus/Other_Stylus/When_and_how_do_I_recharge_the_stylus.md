# When and how do I recharge the stylus?

When the battery capacity of the Bamboo Stylus Fineline 2 reaches about 15%, the LED starts to blink red and you will need to recharge. Remove the cap at the top end of the stylus. Insert the USB cable (included in the box) and connect it to a computer or USB charger. The LED light will display solid red while charging. Your stylus is done charging when the LED light turns off, after approximately 2 hours
