# How do I pair Bamboo Ink 2017 with my devices via Bluetooth®?

To pair your Bamboo Ink 2017 (CS-321):

Go to your Windows Start menu, select Settings> Devices > Bluetooth® and make sure Bluetooth® is “On“.
Hold the top button for 6 seconds then the Blue LED will start blinking.
From the list of devices, select “Bamboo Ink“ and click on “Pair“.
Your pen is paired and ready to be used.



Note: For the top button to properly work when pairing, your Bamboo Ink must be out of the proximity range of the tablet in use (at least 5 cm/ 2 inches away)


Note:  Bamboo Ink 2019 (CS-323A) does not support Bluetooth function  and does not count with a top button.
