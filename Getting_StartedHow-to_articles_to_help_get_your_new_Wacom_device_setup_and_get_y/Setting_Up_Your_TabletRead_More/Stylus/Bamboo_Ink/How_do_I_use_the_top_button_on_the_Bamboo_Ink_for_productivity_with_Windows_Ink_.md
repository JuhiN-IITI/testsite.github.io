# How do I use the top button on the Bamboo Ink for productivity with Windows Ink Workspace?

To enable this function, you need to pair Bamboo Ink to your device via Bluetooth®. After paring to your device, clicking the button gives you direct access to the apps you want to use and a convenient short cut to the Windows Ink Workspace. You can customize the button from “Windows start menu> Setting > Devices> Pen & Windows Ink”. As a default setting, single click to open Windows Ink Workspace, double click allows you to open Screen Sketch and click and hold to open Sticky Notes Note: For the top button to properly work when pairing, your Bamboo Ink must be out of the proximity range of the tablet in use (at least at least 5 cm/ 2 inches away)
