# Do I need to install a specific driver to use a Bamboo Ink with my device?

The Bamboo Ink works with all compatible pen-enabled devices that feature Wacom AES technology or Microsoft Pen Protocol. However, for devices using Wacom AES technology to use some of the unique features like pressure sensitivity in some programs or if there is cursor offset, you can calibrate by installing Wacomâ€™s Tablet PC driver. Note that this driver is not compatible with Microsoft Pen Protocol devices. For more information, please visit our driver page here.
