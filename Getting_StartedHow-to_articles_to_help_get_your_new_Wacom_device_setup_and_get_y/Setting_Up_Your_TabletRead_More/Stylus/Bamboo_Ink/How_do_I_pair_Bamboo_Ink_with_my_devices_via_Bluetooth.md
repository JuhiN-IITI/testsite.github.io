# How do I pair Bamboo Ink with my devices via Bluetooth?

From the Windows Start menu, select Settings> Devices > Bluetooth® and make sure Bluetooth® is “On“. Hold the top button for 6 seconds then the Blue LED will start blinking. From the list of devices, select “Bamboo Ink“ and click on “Pair“. Your pen is paired and ready to be used. Note: For the top button to properly work when pairing, your Bamboo Ink must be out of the proximity range of the tablet in use (at least 5 cm/ 2 inches away)
