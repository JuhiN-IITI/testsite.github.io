# What do the LED lights on top mean on Bamboo Ink?

A Blue LED turns on when you Bamboo Ink is ready for paring. When it is slowly flashing, Bamboo Ink is inside the pairing mode. After your Bamboo Ink is successfully paired with your device, a LED flashes rapidly for 3 seconds. By clicking the top button, Bamboo Ink checks the battery level. When the battery is low, an orange LED will flash 3 times.
