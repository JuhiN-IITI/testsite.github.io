# How precisely does the Bamboo Ink detect pressure?

The Bamboo Ink is a high-precision stylus that continuously detects and transmits the pressure you apply on the surface of your Windows devices. The number of pressure levels depends on your hardware and how the Bamboo Ink sensors and the system software are implemented. Pressure levels can range depending on the device and app used. The devices can support up to 4096 pressure levels. Check your deviceâ€™s user guide to find out how many pressure levels your product supports.
