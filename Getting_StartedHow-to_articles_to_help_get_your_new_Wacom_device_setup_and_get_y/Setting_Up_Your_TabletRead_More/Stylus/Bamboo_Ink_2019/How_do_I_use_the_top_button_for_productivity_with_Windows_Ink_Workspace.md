# How do I use the top button for productivity with Windows Ink Workspace?

To enable this function, you need to pair your Bamboo Ink 2017 (CS-321) to your device via Bluetooth®. After paring to your device, clicking the button gives you direct access to the apps you want to use and a convenient short cut to the Windows Ink Workspace. You can customize the button from “Windows start menu> Setting > Devices> Pen & Windows Ink”. As a default setting, single click to open Windows Ink Workspace, double click allows you to open Screen Sketch and click and hold to open Sticky Notes
 Note: For the top button to properly work when pairing, your Bamboo Ink must be out of the proximity range of the tablet in use (at least at least 5 cm/ 2 inches away)
 Note:  Bamboo Ink 2019 (CS-323A) does not support Bluetooth function and does not count with a top button.
