# Why are there soft, medium and hard tips for the Bamboo Ink?

To give you the most authentic feel while writing and sketching on screens, you can choose between three kinds of pen nibs which can easily be exchanged per your preference.


Note: Bamboo Ink 2019 (CS-323A) does not include these set of nibs from the box . You can purchase this accessory kit (ACK42416) separately.
