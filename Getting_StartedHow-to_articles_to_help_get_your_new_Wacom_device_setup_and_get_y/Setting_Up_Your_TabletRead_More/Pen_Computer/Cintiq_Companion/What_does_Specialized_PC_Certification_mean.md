# What does “Specialized PC Certification” mean?

Microsoft requires us to inform our customers that the Cintiq Companion is a Specialized PC device. This means that it contains a feature that sits outside of the standard Windows 8 certification requirements. To meet the needs of creative professionals, we moved the Windows Home button to the side of the bezel, which provides better functionality for professional design use. As this Windows adjustment was made with Microsoft’s approval, the Cintiq Companion is certified for Windows 8 as a Specialized PC (SPC).


Please note: While we're not aware of any compatibility issues, as part of the Windows 8 certification program, we're obliged to inform our customers that certain features or functionality of Windows 8 may not work as expected.
