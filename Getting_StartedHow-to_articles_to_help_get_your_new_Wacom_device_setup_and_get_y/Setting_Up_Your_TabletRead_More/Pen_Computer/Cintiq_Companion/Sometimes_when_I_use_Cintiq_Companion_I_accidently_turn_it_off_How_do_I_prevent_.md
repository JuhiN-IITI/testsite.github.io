From the home screen, swipe upwards to reveal the "All apps" iconÂ 
Select this icon
Find and activate the "Control Panel" icon under the "Windows System" group
Assuming you are viewing the control panel in "Category" mode, select "Hardware and Sound"
Select "Power Options"
Scroll down to "Power Buttons and Lid" below the ConfigTDP and select "Power Button Action"
Select "Do Nothing" for each of "On Battery" or "Plugged In"
Save your settings and exit.
