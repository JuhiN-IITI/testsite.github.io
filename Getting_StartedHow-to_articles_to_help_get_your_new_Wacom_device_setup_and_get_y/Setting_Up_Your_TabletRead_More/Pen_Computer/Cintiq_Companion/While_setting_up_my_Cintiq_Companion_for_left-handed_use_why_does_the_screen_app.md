# While setting up my Cintiq Companion for left-handed use, why does the screen appear upside down when I first start my computer?

Although the screen appears upside down at first, it will automatically correct itself by the time the Windows log-in page appears. Windows will then retain your settings so that you wonâ€™t need to reset the orientation again.
