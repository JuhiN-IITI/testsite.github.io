# How can I access the recovery partition for a corrupted Windows 8 image on my Cintiq Companion device?

If the Windows 8 image has been corrupted, please reboot while in recovery mode by following the relevant step below:


With a keyboard connected via USB: Press the "F9" button during boot


Without a keyboard: Press the volume up and down simultaneously while also pressing the power button, during boot


You should now be able to reinstall the image.
