# How can I reinstall Windows 8.1?

There are two ways to restore a Windows 8.1 device to the factory default settings.

The first option, "Refresh," will restore the device to the default operating system, although it won’t remove pictures or documents.
The second option, "Remove," will remove all data, and return the device to a completely default state.



To begin restoring using either option, simply follow these steps:

Swipe from the right to open the "Charms" bar 
Then select "Settings"
Open "Change PC Settings"
Select "Update and Recovery"
Select "Recovery"
Then follow the relevant step, depending on your preference:


To restore the system to defaults without removing user data, select "Refresh your PC without affecting your files"
To remove all data, and restore the device to 'like-new,' select "Remove everything and reinstall Windows"
