# How can I move files to and from my Cintiq Companion Hybrid to other devices?

The ASTRO File Manager™ is pre-installed on your Cintiq Companion Hybrid. It easily supports the moving and copying of files, as outlined below:

Copy or move files back and forth to common online services like DropBox™, Google Drive, Box and others similar services.
Copy files to other devices on the same network, via WiFi.
Copy files to and from an attached USB memory stick or Micro SD card.
After the desired files have been copied, you should remove the USB memory stick or Micro SD card and plug it into destination device.
Windows Explorer (PC) or Android File Transfer: These services should be used to copy and paste files when connected via the Wacom 3-in-1 cable to a PC or Mac.



Please note that the Android operating system does not include a function for copying and moving files; you must use ASTRO File Manager™, or a similar file utility.
