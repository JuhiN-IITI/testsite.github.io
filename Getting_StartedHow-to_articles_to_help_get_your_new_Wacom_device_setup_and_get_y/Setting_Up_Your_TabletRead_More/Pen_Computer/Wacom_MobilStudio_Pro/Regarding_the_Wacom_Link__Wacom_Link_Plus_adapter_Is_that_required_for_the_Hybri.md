# Regarding the Wacom Link / Wacom Link Plus adapter: Is that required for the Hybrid Mode, or can other adapters (HDMI) also be used?

Yes, the MobileStudio can be used in Hybrid mode with a computer running Windows or OSX. For this you need the additional Wacom Link / Wacom Link Plus adapter or a USB-C to USB-C supporting DisplayPort Alternate Mode and USB 3.1.
