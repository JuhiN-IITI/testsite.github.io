# Why did Wacom choose to use the Windows 10 operating system?

Wacom chose Windows 10 operating system for the MobileStudio Pro since it is designed for touch with the latest Windows® features Windows 7 doesn’t fully support touch capabilities. Apple OS X does not run on these devices. Apple does not make their operating system available to other manufacturers. Linux was not a viable option since the MobileStudio Pro creative tablets are designed for professionals who primarily use Adobe Photoshop® or Autodesk® software, which runs on Macs and PCs.
