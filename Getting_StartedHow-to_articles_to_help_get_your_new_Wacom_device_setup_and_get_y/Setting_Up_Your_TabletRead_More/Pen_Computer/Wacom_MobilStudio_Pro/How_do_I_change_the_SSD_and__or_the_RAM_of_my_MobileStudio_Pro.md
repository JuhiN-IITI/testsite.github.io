# How do I change the SSD and / or the RAM of my MobileStudio Pro?

This is only possible for the latest generation models released in 2019. 
(Model numbers starting with DTHW1321 and DTHW1621)


NOTE: This procedure may affect your device warranty - More information on warranty here


Be aware, that while this is considered a user-friendly step, there are still risks if not done correctly.
When handling electronic components, always be mindful of static electricity as it can damage your components. Always hold RAM / SSD modules by their edges and avoid touching the golden electrical connectors.
Both when removing or installing a RAM or SSD module, always avoid the use of excessive force.
If you are not sure what to do, please contact our support team using the contact button below.



Having in mind the previously outlined, the first step will be to power off the device and unplug this one from its power supply. Make sure the device is powered off and not in sleep mode or hibernation.


Once this is done, you can remove the plates located on the back of the device by gently removing the screws. Then you can gently remove the modules you want and replace them with your own.


NOTE: If you need factory drivers after upgrading the SSD, please refer to our driver's page for them. 
If you are only upgrading the RAM memory, then there's no need to install any particular drivers in that case.


Please use ONLY RAM or SSD modules that meet the specifications of the slots. Which are:

SSD: PCIe Gen3x2 M.2 2280 NVMe
RAM: DDR4-2400 SO-DIMM



Here's a video on how this is done on the 16" version. The 13" will not have a free RAM slot.
