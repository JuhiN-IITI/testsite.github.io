# How do I adjust the monitor settings of the MobileStudio Pro (e.g., for color calibration) when connected to a PC or Mac?

To change the display settings, open the Wacom Desktop Center and select the MobileStudio Pro. Look for “Display Settings”. From here you can check the Contrast, Brightness and other settings.
