# I’m left-handed. How do I change my MobileStudio Pro so I can use the ExpressKeys on the right side of the display when connected to a PC or Mac?

On Windows:

Swipe from the right-side towards the center of the display to open the “Charms” menu.
Click on “All settings”
Click on “System”
Scroll down until you find “Orientation”
Select the orientation you desire.



On Mac:

Click on the “Apple menu”
Click on “System Preferences”
Open the “Rotation” dropdown menu and make your selection
