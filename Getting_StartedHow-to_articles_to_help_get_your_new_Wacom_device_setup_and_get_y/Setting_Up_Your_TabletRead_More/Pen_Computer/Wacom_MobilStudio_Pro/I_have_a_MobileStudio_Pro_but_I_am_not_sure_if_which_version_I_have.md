# I have a MobileStudio Pro but I am not sure if which version I have?

The easiest way is to check the model number of the device. You can find it in the back of the device.The previous generation model number will end in “20” and the new, 2019 version will end in “21”. For example:

DTH-W1620: Previous version
DTH-W1621: New, 2019 version
