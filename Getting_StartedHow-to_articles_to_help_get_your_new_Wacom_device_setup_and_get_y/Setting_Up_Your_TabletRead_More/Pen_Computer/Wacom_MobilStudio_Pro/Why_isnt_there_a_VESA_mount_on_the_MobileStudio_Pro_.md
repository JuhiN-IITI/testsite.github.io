# Why isn’t there a VESA mount on the MobileStudio Pro ?

Most customers buy a MobileStudio Pro to use on-the-go and a VESA mount is usually intended for stationary desktop use. Also, adding a VESA mount would mean increasing weight and thickness of the device, which is something most customers do not want.
