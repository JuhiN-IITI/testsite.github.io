# What can I do with the color rings that came with my Intuos Pro (2015)?

With an Intuos Pro, customers can use a variety of pens. The color rings help to differentiate one pen from the other. Basically, there are two main scenarios for the rings. First, if you use different pens with unique settings, use the color rings to identify one pen from the other. Second, in surroundings where several people share a work space, the rings are a way to individualize one's own pen.
