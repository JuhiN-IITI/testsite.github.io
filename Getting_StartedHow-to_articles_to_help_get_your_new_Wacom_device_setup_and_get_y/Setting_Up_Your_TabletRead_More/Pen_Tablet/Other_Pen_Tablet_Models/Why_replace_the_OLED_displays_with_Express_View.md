# Why replace the OLED displays with Express View?

Although the OLEDS in Intuos4 were a major improvement over blindly operating an Intuos3 tablet, weâ€™ve improved the customer experience even further. By observing customers, we learned that each time they looked down at the OLED displays to check their settings they lost time. It interrupted their workflow. By replacing the OLEDs with the new Express View display customers can stay focused on their work. With one touch and one glance at the screen they know the status of their application specific settings without distractions.
