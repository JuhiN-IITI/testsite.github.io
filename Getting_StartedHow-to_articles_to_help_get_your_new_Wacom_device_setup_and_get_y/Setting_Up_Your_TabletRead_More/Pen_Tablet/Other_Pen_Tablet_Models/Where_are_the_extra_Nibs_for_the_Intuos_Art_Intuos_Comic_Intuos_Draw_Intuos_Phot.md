# Where are the extra Nibs for the Intuos Art, Intuos Comic, Intuos Draw, Intuos Photo, or Intuos 3D tablet?

The Nibs are stored inside the tablet. To access the Nibs, simply slide off the removable panel on the back of the tablet, the nibs are stored in the middle of the tablet next to the Nib extractor.
