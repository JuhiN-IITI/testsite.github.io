# How do I pair the Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx) to my Chromebook computer via Bluetooth?

To connect your tablet via bluetooth on Chrome OS, follow the steps below.

If your tablet is connected to your computer by USB, disconnect the USB cable.
Open your Chromebook computer's Bluetooth menu and turn on Bluetooth
Press the power button on your tablet until the blue LED starts to blink
If your computer was previously connected to a computer which is now off or out of range, the blue LED above the power button will blink quickly for 15 seconds.
The blue LED slowly blinking indicates the tablet is discoverable by Bluetooth.
In your computer's Bluetooth menu, select your tablet's name when it appears.
Click Pair or complete the pairing process per your operating system's instructions.
The blue LED will stop blinking when your tablet is connected.
Close the Bluetooth menu.



After you pair your computer to your tablet, you can switch between a Bluetooth and USB connection by plugging and unplugging the USB cable.
