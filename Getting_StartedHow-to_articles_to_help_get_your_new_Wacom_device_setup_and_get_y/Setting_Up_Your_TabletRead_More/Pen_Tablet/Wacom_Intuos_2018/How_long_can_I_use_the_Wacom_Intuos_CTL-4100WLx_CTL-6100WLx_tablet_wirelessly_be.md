# How long can I use the Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx) tablet wirelessly before needing to recharge?

When fully charged, you can expect about 15 hours of operating time if you use the product continuously. To conserve the battery, the Wacom Intuos tablet goes into sleep mode after 30 minutes when not in use.
