# How do I use ExpressKeys™ on my Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100x, CTL-6100x, CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx) tablet?

To use the ExpressKeys™, press any of them while your tablet is connected. A semi-transparent pop-up will appear onscreen, showing the current shortcut assigned to each key.


By default, ExpressKey™ functions are pre-assigned for many common applications and update automatically as you switch between them.


You can customize the ExpressKey™ settings in the Wacom Center.
