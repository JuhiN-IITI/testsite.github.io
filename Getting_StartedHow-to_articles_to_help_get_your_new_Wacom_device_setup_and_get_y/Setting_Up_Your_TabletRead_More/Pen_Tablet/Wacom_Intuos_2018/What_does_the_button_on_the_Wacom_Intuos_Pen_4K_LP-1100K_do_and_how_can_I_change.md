# What does the button on the Wacom Intuos Pen 4K (LP-1100K) do and how can I change the function?

The button on the Wacom Intuos pen is divided into two parts: the upper and bottom halves. The default setting for the lower button half is “scroll.” The default setting for the upper button half is “right click.” You can change both settings in the Wacom Desktop Center.
