# What are the dots on the surface of the Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100x, CTL-6100x, CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx) tablet?

The dots on the surface of the tablet indicate the boundaries of the active area. The pen only works in this active area, which relates to your screen through your mapping configuration found in the Wacom Desktop Center.
