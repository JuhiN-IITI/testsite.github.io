# Where can I find the replacement nibs for the Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100x, CTL-6100x, CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx) tablet?

The Wacom Intuos pen comes with three spare nibs stored inside the rear compartment of the pen. To access them:




Unscrew and remove the rear part of your Intuos pen.




Retrieve one of the spare nibs stored inside.




Use the nib removal tool (the small hole at the end of the pen) to gently pull out the used nib.




Insert a new nib by pushing it into the tip of the pen until it fits securely.




If youâ€™ve used all the included nibs, additional nib sets can be purchased through the Wacom eStore.
