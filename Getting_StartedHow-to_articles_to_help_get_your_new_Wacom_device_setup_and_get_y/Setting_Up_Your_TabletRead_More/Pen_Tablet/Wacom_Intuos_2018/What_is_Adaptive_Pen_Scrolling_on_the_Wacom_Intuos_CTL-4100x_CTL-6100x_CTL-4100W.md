# What is Adaptive Pen Scrolling on the Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100x, CTL-6100x, CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx)?

This feature helps to better control the speed and direction of scrolling. Press the lower pen button while touching the tablet with your pen tip anywhere on the tablet. Drag downwards to scroll down. Drag upwards to scroll up. Scrolling continues as long as you touch the tablet with your pen while holding the lower pen button. Control the speed easily by dragging the pen more into the desired direction. Please note that you can also change the scrolling speed and the setting of the lower pen button in the driver control panel.
