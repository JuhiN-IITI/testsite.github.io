# How can I manually switch the Wacom Intuos into Android mode?

If the screen cursor movement on your screen is distorted compared to your pen movement, switch the Wacom Intuos mode manually.

On Android 14 & later, switch to PC mode for no distortion and the ability to use your Intuos tablet with any orientation of your Android device. In PC mode, the LED is lit brightly.
On Android 6-13, switch to Android mode for less distortion. You must use your Android device in vertical orientation. In Android mode, the LED is lit darkly.



To switch from one mode to another, please try the following:

Press and hold the outer most two ExpressKeys on the right and left for 3-4 seconds.
LED lights darkly.
Check if the pen works.



LED lights brightly →PC（Windows/mac） mode


 


LED lights darkly →Android mode
