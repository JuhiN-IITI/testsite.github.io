# How do I change the mapping (Active area) on the Wacom Intuos when using an Android tablet?

The active area cannot be changed. On Android 14 & later with the Android device in vertical orientation, only the left portion of the tablet area is active for pen input. With the Android device in horizontal orientation, most of the tablet area is active for pen input.


Important: If the screen cursor movement is distorted compared to the pen movement on your Wacom Intuos, switch the Wacom Intuos mode manually.Â 


On Android 6-13, the active area cannot be changed. The active area is mapped to the left side of the tablet as shown in the image below. When using Android 8-13, Wacom strongly recommends using the Android device in a vertical orientation due to pen input limitations in those versions of Android.
