# How do I charge the battery in my Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx) tablet?

To charge your tablet, simply connect it to your computer or power adapter using the USB cable. We recommend beginning to charge the tablet when the LED starts blinking orange, which indicates that you only have 10% battery level left.
