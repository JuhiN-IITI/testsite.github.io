# Can I connect the Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx) to a second computer with Bluetooth?

The Wacom Intuos tablets can only be connected to one computer. Connection to a second computer needs re-pairing:

If the first computer is on and within range of the tablet: 
  
Unpair your pen tablet from your first computer in the computer's Bluetooth menu.
The LED on the pen tablet will turn off to indicate the connection has been lost.
 
Confirm the driver is installed on your second computer.
Repeat the connection steps here: How do I pair the Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx) to my computer via Bluetooth?
