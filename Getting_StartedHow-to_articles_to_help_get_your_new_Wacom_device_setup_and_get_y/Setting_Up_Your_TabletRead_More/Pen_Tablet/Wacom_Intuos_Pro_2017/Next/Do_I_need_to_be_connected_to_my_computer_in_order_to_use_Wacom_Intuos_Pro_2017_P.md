# Do I need to be connected to my computer in order to use Wacom Intuos Pro (2017) Paper Edition?

You do not need to be connected to your computer to paper sketch. Paper sketching can operate standalone, meaning you can sketch away from your computer and your sketches will be saved in Intuos Pro internal memory. Once you return to your desk, you can transfer your sketches to your computer using the Wacom Inkspace App.
