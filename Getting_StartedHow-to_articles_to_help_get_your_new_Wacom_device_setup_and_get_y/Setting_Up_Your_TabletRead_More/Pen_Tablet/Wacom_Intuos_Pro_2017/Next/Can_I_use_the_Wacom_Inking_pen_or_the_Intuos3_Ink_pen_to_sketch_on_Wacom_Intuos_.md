# Can I use the Wacom Inking pen or the Intuos3 Ink pen to sketch on Wacom Intuos Pro (2017) Paper Edition?

The Wacom Inking pen and the Intuos3 Ink pen are not compatible with Intuos Pro for paper sketching. You must use the new Wacom Finetip Pen or Wacom Ballpoint Pen, made specifically for the Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-660 or PTH-860).
