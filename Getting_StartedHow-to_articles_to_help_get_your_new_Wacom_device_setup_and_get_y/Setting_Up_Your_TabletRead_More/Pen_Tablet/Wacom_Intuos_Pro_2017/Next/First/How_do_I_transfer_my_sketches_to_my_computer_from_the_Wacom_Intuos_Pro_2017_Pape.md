# How do I transfer my sketches to my computer from the Wacom Intuos Pro (2017) Paper Edition?

Connect your Wacom Intuos Pro via USB or Bluetooth and open the Wacom Inkspace App. If you have previously connected your Intuos Pro with the app, your sketches will transfer automatically. If you have not, you will need to complete setup first in order to transfer your sketches.
