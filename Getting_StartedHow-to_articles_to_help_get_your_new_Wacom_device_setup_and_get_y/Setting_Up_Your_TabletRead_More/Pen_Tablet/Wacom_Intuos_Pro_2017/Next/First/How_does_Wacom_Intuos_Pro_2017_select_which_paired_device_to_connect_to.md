# How does Wacom Intuos Pro (2017) select which paired device to connect to?

When Wacom Intuos Pro M and L start up in wireless mode, it first attempts to connect to the most recently connected computer and then to the second paired computer and finally to your paired mobile device. Once Wacom Intuos Pro has connected to a device, it will not change the connection until it is restarted. If it goes to sleep and then wakes up, it will only connect to the same device that it was connected to prior to sleeping. You will need to restart Wacom Intuos Pro in order for it to search for any of your paired devices again.
