# How do I turn on paper sketching on the Wacom Intuos Pro (2017) Paper Edition?

Simply bring your Wacom Finetip pen close to the tablet surface to switch the tablet function to paper sketching. You will see a green “+” LED appear on the center button of the Touch Ring. Wacom recommends that you download the driver and install the Wacom Inkspace App prior to creating your first sketch.
