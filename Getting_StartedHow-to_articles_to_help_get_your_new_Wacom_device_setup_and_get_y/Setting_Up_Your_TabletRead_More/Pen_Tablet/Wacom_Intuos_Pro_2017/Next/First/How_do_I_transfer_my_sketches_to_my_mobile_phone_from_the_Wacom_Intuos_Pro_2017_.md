# How do I transfer my sketches to my mobile phone from the Wacom Intuos Pro (2017) Paper Edition?

Install Wacom Inkspace App on your mobile device from an app store. Then using the Wacom Inkspace App, pair your Intuos Pro tablet to your mobile device using Bluetooth. If you have previously connected your Intuos Pro with the app, your sketches will transfer automatically. If you have not, you will need to complete setup first in order to transfer your sketches.
