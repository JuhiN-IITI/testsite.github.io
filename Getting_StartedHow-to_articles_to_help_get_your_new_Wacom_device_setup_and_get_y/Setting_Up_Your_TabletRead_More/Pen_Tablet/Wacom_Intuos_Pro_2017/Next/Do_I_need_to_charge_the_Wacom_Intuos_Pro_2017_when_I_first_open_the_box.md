# Do I need to charge the Wacom Intuos Pro (2017) when I first open the box?

We recommend that you charge your Intuos Pro tablet when you first receive it if you plan to connect to your computer using a Bluetooth connection. To charge, simply connect it to a working computer using the USB cable inside your box.
