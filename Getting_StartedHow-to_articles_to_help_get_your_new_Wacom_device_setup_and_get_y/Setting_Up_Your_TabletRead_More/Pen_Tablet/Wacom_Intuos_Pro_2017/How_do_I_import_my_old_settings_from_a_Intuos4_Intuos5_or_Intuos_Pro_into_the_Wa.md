# How do I import my old settings from a Intuos4, Intuos5, or Intuos Pro into the Wacom Intuos Pro (2017)?

You can import old settings using the settings import tool. This tool can be accessed in the Setup Wizard during driver installation. If you skipped that step during setup, you can re-run the setup wizard from the Wacom Desktop Center.
