# Can I use any size paper with my Bamboo Spark?

Yes, you can use most office-sized paper, up to 50 pages or approximately 5 mm or 1/5 inch thick with the Bamboo Spark, but only work captured in the active area will be transferred to the digital version. For that reason, we recommend using A5 paper (148 x 210 mm or 5.8 x 8.3 inches). 5.8 x 8.3 in). The Bamboo Spark is designed for use with standard A5 size office notepads that open from the top.
