# How do I share or export my notes?

You can export or share notes from the Inkspace app or online from the Inkspace web portal. Your notes can be exported in a variety of single-layer file formats including JPG, PDF or WILL (Wacom Ink Layer Language). You can also convert your handwritten notes to text and easily export them as plain text to other text applications. This is a premium Inkspace feature.
