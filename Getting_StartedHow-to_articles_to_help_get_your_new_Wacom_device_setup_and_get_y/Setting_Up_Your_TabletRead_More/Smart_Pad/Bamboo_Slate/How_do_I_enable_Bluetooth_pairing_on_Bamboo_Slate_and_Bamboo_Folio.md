On Windows and Mac, the Wacom Inkspace app will guide you through the pairing process. In addition, make sure your Bamboo Slate or Bamboo Folio is turn on. Then press and hold the button for about 6 second until the LED start blinking blue. Please note the LED will turn off for less than 3 second before it starts blinking blue.
