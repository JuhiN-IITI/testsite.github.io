# How do I enable Bluetooth pairing on Bamboo Slate and Bamboo Folio?

On Windows and Mac, the Wacom Inkspace app will guide you through the pairing process. In addition, make sure your Bamboo Slate or Bamboo Folio is turn on. Then press and hold the button for about 6 second until the LED start blinking blue. Please note the LED will turn off for less than 3 second before it starts blinking blue.


Note for Mac OS users: If using the Wacom Inkspace App, additional permissions may be required.
Normally a permissions request will appear after installing the App, but in case it doesn't you might need to do this manually. Please open click the Apple menu, select System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy tab > BluetoothÂ and enable the Inkspace App.
