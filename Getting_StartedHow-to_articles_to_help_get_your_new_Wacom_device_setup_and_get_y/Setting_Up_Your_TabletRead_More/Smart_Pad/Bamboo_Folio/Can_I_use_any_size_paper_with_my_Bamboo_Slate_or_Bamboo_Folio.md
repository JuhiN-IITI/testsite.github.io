# Can I use any size paper with my Bamboo Slate or Bamboo Folio?

Yes, you can use most office-sized paper, up to 80 pages or approximately 8 mm or ~0.3 inch thick with the Bamboo Slate or Bamboo Folio, but only work captured in the active area will be transferred to the digital version. For that reason, we recommend using A5 paper (148 x 210 mm or 5.8 x 8.3 inches). The Bamboo Slate and Bamboo Folio are designed for use with standard A5 size office notepads that open from the top.
