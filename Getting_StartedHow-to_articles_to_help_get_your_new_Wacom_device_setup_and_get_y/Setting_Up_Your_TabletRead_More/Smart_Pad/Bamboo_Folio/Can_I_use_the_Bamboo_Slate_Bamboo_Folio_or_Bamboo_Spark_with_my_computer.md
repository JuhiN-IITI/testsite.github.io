# Can I use the Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, or Bamboo Spark with my computer?

No, you cannot directly use Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, or Bamboo Spark with your computer. However, using an Inkspace (Wacom ID) account, you can upload your files to the cloud. Once in the cloud, you can access your files in JPG and PDF format from another device by going to inkspace.wacom.com.
