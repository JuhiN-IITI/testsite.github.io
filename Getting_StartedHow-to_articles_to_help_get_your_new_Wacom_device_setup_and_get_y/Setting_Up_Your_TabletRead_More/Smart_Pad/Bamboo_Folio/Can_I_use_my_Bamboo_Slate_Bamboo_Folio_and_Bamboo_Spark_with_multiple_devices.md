# Can I use my Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, and Bamboo Spark with multiple devices?

Yes, you can use your Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, and Bamboo Spark with different devices as long as the device is compatible. See our compatibility list at wacom.com/comp. However, you can only connect Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, and Bamboo Spark to one device at a time. It is possible to install and use Wacom Inkspace app on multiple devices though. To access notes on a web, go to inkspace.wacom.com.
