# Do I have to use my tablet or smartphone when using my Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, or Bamboo Spark?

No, you do not need to have your device with you in order to use your Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, or Bamboo Spark. The Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, and Bamboo Spark has its own memory and can hold up to 100 pages before you need to transfer files to your device. You will know when the memory is full when the red LED above the button are illuminated.
