# Can I use the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine while my Cintiq is connected to the Wacom Flex Arm?

Yes. You must attach the Cintiq Pro Engine to the Cintiq Pro first then route the cables through the grommets on the custom bracket, attach the bracket to your Cintiq Pro and then attach the bracket to the Flex Arm. Please review the Wacom Flex Arm Quick Start Guide that came with your arm for detailed installation instructions:
