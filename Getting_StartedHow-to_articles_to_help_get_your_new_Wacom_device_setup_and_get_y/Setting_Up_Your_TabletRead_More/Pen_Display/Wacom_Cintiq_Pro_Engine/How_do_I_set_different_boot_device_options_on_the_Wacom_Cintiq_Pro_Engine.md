# How do I set different boot device options on the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine?

Turn on the Wacom Cintiq Pro Studio (Wacom Cintiq Pro & Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine)


When logged in to the Windows desktop, go to ‘Settings’ → ‘Update & Security’ → ‘Recovery’ → ‘Restart Now’


The computer will boot into Safe mode. Note: you will need a Standard USB Keyboard and Mouse to be connected to the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine as the onscreen keyboard and pen/touch is not supported in Safe Mode


Select ‘Use a device’


Select the device you wish to use


The Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine will restart and attempt to boot to the device you have selected
