# How do I setup a Virtual Reality (VR) Head-Mounted Display (HMD) system on the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine?

Before setting up a VR HMD, you need to prepare the following:

USB-C to USB-A (3.0) adaptor (for HMD)
HDMI to mini HDMI adaptor (for HMD)
USB-C to USB-A (3.0) hub with 2 or more ports (for any sensors if needed)



 


A VR HMD usually has two connectors on the cable, USB-A 3.0 and HDMI. We recommend referring to the included Quick Start Guide, Wacom tutorial videos, or the online User Manual for more detail, however, here the steps for setting up a VR HMD with the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine.


 


To connect with VR/AR HMD:

Connect the USB-C to USB-A (3.0) adaptor into the USB-C port located adjacent to the mini-HDMI port
Connect the USB-A cable from the HMD into the USB-C to USB-A (3.0) adaptor
Connect the HDMI to mini HDMI adaptor into the miniHDMI port on the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine
Connect the HDMI cable from the HMD to the mini HDMI adaptor



 


To connect with VR/AR sensors:

Connect the USB-C to USB-A (3.0) Hub into the USB-C port located adjacent to the LAN port (in the middle of the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine).
Connect the USB-A cable from the sensors into the USB-C to USB-A (3.0) Hub. PLEASE ONLY CONNECT THE SENSOR CABLE TO THE USB-C PORT ADJACENT TO THE LAN (NETWORK) PORT ON THE WACOM CINTIQ PRO ENGINE.
Download and run the setup software provided by the manufacturer of your HMD.
