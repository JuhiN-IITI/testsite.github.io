 Additional notes


The USB Type-C port located adjacent to the mini-HDMI port only supports a data connection. There is no video output from this port as it does not support DisplayPort alternate mode.


The mini DisplayPort port can be connected using the mini DisplayPort  to DisplayPort adaptor supplied with the Wacom Cintiq Pro 24 or 32 to connect to a DisplayPort port on a monitor.


We recommend using a mini HDMI to HDMI cable to connect to a HDMI monitor. When using a mini HDMI to HDMI adaptor, please ensure it will support 4K (UHD 3840 x 2160) /60Hz.


The connection of external monitors at high resolutions may be impacted by the the length of the cable being used. Wacom has conducted compatibility testing with a number of computers currently available on the market. If you are experiencing video connectivity issues, please test the connection with a shorter cable in order to cover the performance variance between devices.
