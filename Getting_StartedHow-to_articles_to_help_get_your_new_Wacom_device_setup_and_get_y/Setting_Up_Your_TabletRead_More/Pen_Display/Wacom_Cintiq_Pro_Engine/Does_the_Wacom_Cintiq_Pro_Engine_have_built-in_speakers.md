# Does the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine have built-in speakers?

Neither the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine or Wacom Cintiq Pro 24 or 32 have built-in speakers. The pen display will show as an audio device in the operating system, however sound will only be heard if an audio device (such as headphones) are connected to the built-in Wacom Cintiq Pro audio jack.
