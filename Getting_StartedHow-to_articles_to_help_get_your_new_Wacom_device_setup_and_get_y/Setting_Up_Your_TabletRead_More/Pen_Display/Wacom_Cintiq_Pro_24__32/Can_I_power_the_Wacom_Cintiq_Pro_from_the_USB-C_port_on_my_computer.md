# Can I power the Wacom Cintiq Pro from the USB-C port on my computer?

Due to the power requirements of the Wacom Cintiq Pro series, the included Wacom AC Power Adapter is required to operate the device. A standard USB-C port on a computer does not supply sufficient power for these models.


 

 
Power Requirements by Model




Wacom Cintiq Pro 13 / 16


• Requires: Wacom 48W AC Power Adapter




Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (2021)


• Requires: Wacom 45W AC Power Adapter (included)




Wacom Cintiq Pro 17


• Requires: Wacom 70W AC Power Adapter (20V / 3.5A)




Wacom Cintiq Pro 22


• Requires: Wacom 160W AC Power Adapter (19V / 8.4A)




Wacom Cintiq Pro 24 / 32


• Requires: Wacom 180W AC Power Adapter




Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (2022)


• Requires: Wacom 230W AC Power Adapter




 



 


Attempting to power your Wacom Cintiq Pro directly from a computer’s USB-C port will not provide adequate power, and the device will not function correctly. Always use the designated Wacom AC Power Adapter included with your device to ensure optimal performance.
