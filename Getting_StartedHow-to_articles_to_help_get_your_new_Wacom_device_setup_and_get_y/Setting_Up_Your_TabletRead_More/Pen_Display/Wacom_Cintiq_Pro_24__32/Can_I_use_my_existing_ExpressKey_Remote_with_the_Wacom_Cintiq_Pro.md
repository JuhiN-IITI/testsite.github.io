# Can I use my existing ExpressKey Remote with the Wacom Cintiq Pro?

Yes — you can use your existing ExpressKey Remote (EKR) with the Wacom Cintiq Pro or any other setup, even if you’re not using a Wacom pen display at all.


 


The ExpressKey Remote functions independently of any specific Wacom device. It connects via a wireless USB-A dongle and works as long as the Wacom driver is installed on your computer. This means the EKR behaves the same across all supported setups.


 



 
How to connect the ExpressKey Remote


Plug the wireless USB-A dongle into your computer or available port on your Wacom Display. (If your computer only has USB-C ports, use a USB-C to USB-A adapter.)




Power on the ExpressKey Remote.




Open Wacom Center (or Wacom Desktop Center, depending on your driver version).




The EKR should appear under connected devices.




Customize the buttons for your applications from Wacom Center.





 
Where to plug in the dongle




The dongle should be connected directly to your computer’s USB-A port.




Some Wacom devices, like the Cintiq Pro 24, Cintiq Pro 32, or Wacom Link adapters, include built-in USB-A ports where the dongle can also be connected.




However, the dongle does not need to be connected to the Wacom device. It only needs to be connected to the system running the Wacom driver.





 
Important notes




The ExpressKey Remote will function even if no Wacom device is connected, as long as the Wacom driver is installed.




Customization is done via Wacom Center, available from the Wacom Driver page.





 
Troubleshooting tips


If your ExpressKey Remote isn’t being detected:




Ensure the dongle is securely connected.




Confirm the remote is charged.




Restart Wacom Center and make sure you’re using the latest driver.




Re-pair the remote if needed through the pairing option in Wacom Center.
