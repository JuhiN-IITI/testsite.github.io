# Do I need to download a driver to use the Wacom Cintiq Pro 24 or 32 with the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine attached?

No, all required drivers have been pre-installed on the Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine, including the Wacom Desktop Center. To ensure the best experience and performance, we recommend you regularly check the “Updates” section in the Wacom Desktop Center for the latest Wacom drivers and firmware.
