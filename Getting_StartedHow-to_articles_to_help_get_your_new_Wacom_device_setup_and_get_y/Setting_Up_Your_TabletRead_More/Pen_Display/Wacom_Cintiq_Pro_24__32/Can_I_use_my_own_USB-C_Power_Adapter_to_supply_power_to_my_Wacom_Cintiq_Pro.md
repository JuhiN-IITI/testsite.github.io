# Can I use my own USB-C Power Adapter to supply power to my Wacom Cintiq Pro?

Wacom Cintiq Pro is designed to use standard USB-C power delivery. The USB-C 48W or USB-C 180W Wacom AC Power Adapter supplied with your Wacom Cintiq Pro has been thoroughly tested for use with your device. We recommend powering your Wacom Cintiq Pro with the adapter included with your device only. Use of any other Power source is NOT recommended, outside the scope of the Wacom Limited Warranty and will be at your own risk.


A replacement or additional Wacom Cintiq Pro AC Power Adapter can be purchased from Wacom. For more information, please visit the Wacom Cintiq Pro product page on wacom.com.
