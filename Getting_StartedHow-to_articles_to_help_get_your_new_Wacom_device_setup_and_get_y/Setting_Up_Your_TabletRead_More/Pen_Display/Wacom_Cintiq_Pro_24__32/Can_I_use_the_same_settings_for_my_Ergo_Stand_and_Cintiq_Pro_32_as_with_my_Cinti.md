# Can I use the same settings for my Ergo Stand and Cintiq Pro 32 as with my Cintiq Pro 24, or do I need separate stands for each device?

Yes, you need a different stand for each device since the inner construction counterweight and lever sizes are different, and the settings between the Ergo Stand 24-inch and 32-inch are not compatible.
