# Can I use my current Pro Pen on a Wacom Cintiq Pro?

Yes, the previous generation of pens (for example those included with the Cintiq Companion 2, Cintiq 22HD & 27 QHD), including the Pro Pen, are compatible with the Wacom Cintiq Pro and will perform as they do on previous generation products. However, the best pen experience will be achieved on the Wacom Cintiq Pro using the new Pro Pen 2 that ships with the pen display. The new Pro Pen 2 technology gives enhanced pressure sensitivity, improved jitter, improved edge accuracy and other new features implemented in Wacom's latest Pen technology.
