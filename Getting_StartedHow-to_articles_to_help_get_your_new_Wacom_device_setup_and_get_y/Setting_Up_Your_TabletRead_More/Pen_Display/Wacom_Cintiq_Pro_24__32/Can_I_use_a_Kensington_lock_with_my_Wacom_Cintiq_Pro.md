# Can I use a Kensington lock with my Wacom Cintiq Pro?

Yes. The Wacom Cintiq Pro is equipped with a Kensington® security slot. For the Cintiq Pro 13/16, the slot is compatible with the Kensington® MiniSaver™ Mobile Lock due to its slim design. For the Cintiq Pro 24/32, there is a standard Kensington Security slot. You can find more information on the locks from the Kensington website.
