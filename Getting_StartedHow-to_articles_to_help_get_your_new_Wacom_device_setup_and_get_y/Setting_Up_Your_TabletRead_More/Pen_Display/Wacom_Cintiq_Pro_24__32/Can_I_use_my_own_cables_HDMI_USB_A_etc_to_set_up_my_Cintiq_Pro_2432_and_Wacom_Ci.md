# Can I use my own cables (HDMI, USB A, etc.) to set up my Cintiq Pro 24/32 and Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine with the Ergo stand?

Wacom recommends to set up the Ergo Stand using the cables provided in the box to connect to your Cintiq Pro 32 & 24 / Wacom Cintiq Pro Engine.
 Each bundled cable has the specific length, width and white stripes used for alignment for setting up the device properly into the Ergo Stand.
