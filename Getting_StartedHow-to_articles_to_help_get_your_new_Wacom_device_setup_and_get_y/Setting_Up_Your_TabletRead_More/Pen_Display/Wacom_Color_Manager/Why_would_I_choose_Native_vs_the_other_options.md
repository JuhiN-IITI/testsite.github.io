# Why would I choose Native vs. the other options?

Many design creative users will want to use the full color gamut possible on the Cintiq, and do not require that the display correspond to any industry specification. Alternately, the Cintiq 27 offers the ability to be specifically set for use with industry color space descriptions such as AdobeRGB and Rec. 709. Your specific choice will vary depending on your needs.
