# I measured my other (non-Wacom) displayâ€™s luminance. Now what?

If you are using two displays, setting them to the same luminance level is critical if you wish to see similar color results. Display color temperature will change with the luminance level set, so establishing a common luminance setting is an important step in making displays look more similar. The Wacom Color Manager software will automatically adjust the luminance of the Cintiq 27 display to the desired level. You will need to duplicate this luminance level of a non-Wacom display by manually adjusting the brightness level of the display.
