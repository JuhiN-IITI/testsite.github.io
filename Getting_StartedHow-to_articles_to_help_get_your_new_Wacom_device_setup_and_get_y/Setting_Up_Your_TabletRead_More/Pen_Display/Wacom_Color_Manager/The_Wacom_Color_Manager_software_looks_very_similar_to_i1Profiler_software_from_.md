# The Wacom Color Manager software looks very similar to i1Profiler software from X-Rite. Can I use i1Profiler software instead?

The Wacom Color Manager software is based on i1Profiler technology. But please use the Wacom Color Manager software in order to access the hardware color controls to achieve best results on a Cintiq 27QHD. Use of i1Profiler is possible, but not optimal.
