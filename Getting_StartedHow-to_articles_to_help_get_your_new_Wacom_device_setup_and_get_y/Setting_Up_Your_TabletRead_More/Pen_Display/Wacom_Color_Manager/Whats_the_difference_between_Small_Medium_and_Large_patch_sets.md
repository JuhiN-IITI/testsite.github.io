# Whatâ€™s the difference between Small, Medium and Large patch sets?

By using a larger number of color values for measurement, the software has the ability to make a more accurate profile. However not all images may show a visual difference or improvement by choosing a larger number of patch values. We would recommend you start with the Small patch set, in order to have a baseline for evaluation, should you choose to try the other larger patch sets. Yes, a larger patch set will take more time to measure.
