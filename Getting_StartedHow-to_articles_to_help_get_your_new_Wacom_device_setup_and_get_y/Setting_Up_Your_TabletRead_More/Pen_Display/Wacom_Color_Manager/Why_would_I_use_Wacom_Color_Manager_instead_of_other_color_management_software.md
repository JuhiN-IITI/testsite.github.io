# Why would I use Wacom Color Manager instead of other color management software?

Although Cintiq Pros can be profiled by most professional color management software, only Wacom Color Manager writes to the internal LUTs of the display. By writing to the hardware LUTs, the profiles are made accessible from the display OSD, rather than having to profile the display on each graphics card to which the display is attached. Displays without internal LUTs must all be profiled on each computer. Because Wacom Color Manager is built specifically to profile Cintiq Pros, it has also been optimized to perform the calibration and profiling process in about half the time of a generic display with most profiling software.
