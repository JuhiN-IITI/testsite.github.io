# What do the Page Data “Load” and “Save” buttons do? Do I need to use them?

One benefit of the Advanced mode is the ability to save information at any point in the workflow. Many people would choose to save their measurement file prior to moving to the final stage of creating the display profile. Being able to review a measurement file can be helpful if you encounter an error in creating a profile. You can then reload that saved measurement file and see if a change in profile creation settings will allow you to complete the profile. This saves considerable time vs. having to redo the entire measurement process.
