# What does "Powered by X-Rite" mean?

We have an OEM agreement in place with X-Rite, the global leader in color trends, science and technology. The Wacom Color Manager is a customized version of X-Riteâ€™s i1DisplayPro monitor calibrator. X-Rite customized their calibration software so it talks directly to the display scalar in the Cintiq 27QHD and has auto adjustments to get more precise color, depending on the workflow mode selected. (These would include REC 709, sRGB, to name just a few color standards).
