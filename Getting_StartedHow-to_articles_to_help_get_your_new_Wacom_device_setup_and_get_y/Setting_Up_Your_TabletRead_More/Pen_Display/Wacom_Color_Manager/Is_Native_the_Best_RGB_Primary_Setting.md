# Is Native the Best RGB Primary Setting?

There is no “best” choice in color settings, as it is very dependent on the end user and graphic workflow in use. However, setting to Native would be a reasonable choice for a graphic artist who is using the Cintiq as a creative medium. Other RGB setting choices are more industry specific.
