# I measured my Ambient Light levels. Why do I get two measurements? (lx and cd/m2)

Ambient light levels can be expressed in different units of measurement. Lx refers to Lux, and would be a unit of measurement used in video or scientific environments. Cd/m2 refers to Candela per square meter, and is a more commonly used unit of measurement in the photographic and printing industries.
