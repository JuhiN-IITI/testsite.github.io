# Whatâ€™s the difference between choosing Basic or Advanced mode on the home screen?

The Basic mode will set correct settings for color temperature, luminance and contrast, then display the colors needed to create the ICC profile. This quick procedure will give a good result on the Cintiq 27 display. The Advanced mode will use the Automatic Display Calibration feature and do an in-depth setting of the hardware color controls in the display before displaying the colors needed to create a profile. Using the Advanced mode will give an excellent result, but will take a longer time. Graphics professionals and color critical users will find many industry specific option choices available in this mode
