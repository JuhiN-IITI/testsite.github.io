# Can I make changes in my menu settings after creating and saving my profile?

If, after you create and save a monitor profile in Wacom Color Manager, you then go and make physical changes to the OSD settings for brightness, contrast or color cast, you will be invalidating the profile you created. If you do make any such changes, please note them, so you can change them back when you wish to restore the color result from the profile most recently created or chosen.
