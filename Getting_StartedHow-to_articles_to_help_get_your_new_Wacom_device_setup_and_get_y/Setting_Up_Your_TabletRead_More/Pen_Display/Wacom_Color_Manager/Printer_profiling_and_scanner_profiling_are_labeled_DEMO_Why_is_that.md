# Printer profiling and scanner profiling are labeled “DEMO”. Why is that?

Connecting the Wacom Color Calibrator will permit display or projector profiling. You will need to have the Wacom Color Calibrator connected for these functions to be available. The software does have the ability to be used for printer and scanner profiling, but you will need to have an X-Rite spectrophotometer connected to use those features. You could connect an i1Pro, i1PRO2, i1 iO table, i1 iSis or i1 iSis2 model to enable printer profiling.


Please note that your i1 spectrophotometer must already contain i1Profiler licenses for printer or scanner profiling to allow Wacom Color Manager software to create a printer or scanner profile.
