# I’m left-handed. How do I change my Cintiq 13HD so I can use the ExpressKeys on the right side of the display?

Simply follow these instructions to enable left-handed use of the ExpressKeys, based on your operating system.
 
 Windows: Go to the Control Panel and select "Display,” then change the setting from "Landscape" to "Landscape Flipped.”


Mac OS: Go to Preferences, and select “Standard,” and change the setting to "180°”



 Note: You may need to turn off “mirror mode” in order to see the control panel option for the rotation of the display. After changing the rotation, you can revert back to mirror mode, and your tablet will operate automatically with the ExpressKeys on the right.
