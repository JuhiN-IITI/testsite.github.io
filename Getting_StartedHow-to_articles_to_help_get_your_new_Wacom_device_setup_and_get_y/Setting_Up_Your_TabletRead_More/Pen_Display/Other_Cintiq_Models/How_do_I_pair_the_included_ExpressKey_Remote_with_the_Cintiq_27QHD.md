# How do I pair the included ExpressKey Remote with the Cintiq 27QHD?

The ExpressKey Remote comes pre-paired from the factory with an RF receiver. You can find it inside the left hand side compartment on the back. There is normally no need to remove the receiver although it can be used on any USB port.


If your ExpressKey Remote loses its pairing you can re-pair by holding the ExpressKey Remote close to the left hand side of Cintiq 27QHD while holding “ON” the ExpressKey Remote power slider until the blue light at the bottom of the ExpressKey Remote begins to flash.


Each Cintiq 27QHD receiver can have 5 ExpressKey Remotes paired at a time. Each ExpressKey Remote can only be paired with one Cintiq/receiver however. Using an ExpressKey Remote on a different Cintiq/receiver will require pairing.
