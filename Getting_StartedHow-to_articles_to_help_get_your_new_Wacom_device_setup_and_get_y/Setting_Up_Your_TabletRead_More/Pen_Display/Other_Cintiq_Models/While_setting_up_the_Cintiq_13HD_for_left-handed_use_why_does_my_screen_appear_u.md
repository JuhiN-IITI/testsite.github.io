# While setting up the Cintiq 13HD for left-handed use, why does my screen appear upside down when I first start my computer?

Although the screen initially appears upside down, it will automatically correct itself by the time the Windows log-in page appears. Windows will then retain your settings so that you wonâ€™t need to reset the orientation again.
