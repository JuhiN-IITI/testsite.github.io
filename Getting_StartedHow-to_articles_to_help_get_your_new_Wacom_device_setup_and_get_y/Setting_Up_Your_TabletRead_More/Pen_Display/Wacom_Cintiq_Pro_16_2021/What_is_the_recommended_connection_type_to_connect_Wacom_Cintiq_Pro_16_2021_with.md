# What is the recommended connection type to connect Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (2021) with my computer?

We recommend connecting your Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 to your computer using USB-C (DP Alternate Mode) for optimum performance. If your computer is not equipped with USB-C (Alterative Mode/Thunderbolt 3), you can use a HDMI 2.0* port and USB-C (minimum USB 2.0) or a HDMI 2.0* port and USB-C with included USB-A adapter (minimum USB 2.0).
*You can use with HDMI 1.4 but maximum resolution is WQHD (2560*1440).
