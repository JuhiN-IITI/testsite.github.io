# Can I use my own Power Adapter to supply power to my Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (2021)?

Wacom Cintiq Pro is designed to use the Wacom AC Power Adapter supplied with your Wacom Cintiq Pro 16. We recommend powering your Wacom Cintiq Pro with the adapter included with your device only. Use of any other Power source is NOT recommended, outside the scope of the Wacom Limited Warranty and will be at your own risk.


A replacement or additional Wacom Cintiq Pro AC Power Adapter can be purchased from Wacom. For more information, please visit the Wacom Cintiq Pro product page on wacom.com.
