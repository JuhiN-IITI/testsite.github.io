# There are clips, screws and a screwdriver in my Wacom Stand Cintiq Pro Stand box. What are they used for?

For some Cintiq Pro 13/16 units, it may be difficult to attach the stand to the unit. You may need to replace the clips on your Cintiq Pro. Please use the clip kit provided in in the box, under the Quick Start Guide, which includes:

4 clips, 
4 screws, 
1 Torx screwdriver 
1 instruction card



Also, please watch this Clip Replacement Tutorial Video or follow these step-by-step instructions to replace your clips:

Carefully remove the clips, small screws and screwdriver from the package.
Using the screwdriver, loosen all 4 screws on the back of the device.
Carefully push on the end of the clip furthest from the screw opening to lift the clip off the back of the device.
Insert all 4 new clips first to ensure you do not accidentally drop the screws into the device.
Insert the new screws and tighten until you feel some resistance.
Attach the Wacom Stand to your Cintiq Pro. 



CAUTION: DO NOT overtighten as this may strip the screw and damage your device!
