# Can I charge my USB devices using the USB-C ports on the Wacom Cintiq Pro 13/16?

You can charge your USB device by a power supplied by USB connector up to 5W (5V, 1A). You may experience slow charging speed on devices required higher charging power. Please check power requirement of your USB devices. Wacom is not responsible for damage by devices requiring more than 5W power.
