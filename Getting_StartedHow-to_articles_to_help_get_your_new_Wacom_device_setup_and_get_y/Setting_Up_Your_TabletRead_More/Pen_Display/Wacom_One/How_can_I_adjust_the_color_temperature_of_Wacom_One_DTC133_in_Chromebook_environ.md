# How can I adjust the color temperature of Wacom One (DTC133) in Chromebook environment?

The default value of color temperature is 6500K. Long press the power key for 6 seconds will turn the color temperature to 7500K. Other values can only be set via MacOS or Windows environment due to Chrome OS specifications.
