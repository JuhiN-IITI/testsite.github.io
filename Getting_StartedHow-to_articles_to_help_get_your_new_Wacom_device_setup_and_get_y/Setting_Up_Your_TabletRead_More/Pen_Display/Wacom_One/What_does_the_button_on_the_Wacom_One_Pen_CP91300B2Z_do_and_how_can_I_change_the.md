# What does the button on the Wacom One Pen (CP91300B2Z) do and how can I change the function?

There is only one button on the Wacom One Pen. Due to the inner structure design, only the upper half of the button is pressable. The default setting of the button is Right Click. You can change the settings in the Wacom Desktop Center.
