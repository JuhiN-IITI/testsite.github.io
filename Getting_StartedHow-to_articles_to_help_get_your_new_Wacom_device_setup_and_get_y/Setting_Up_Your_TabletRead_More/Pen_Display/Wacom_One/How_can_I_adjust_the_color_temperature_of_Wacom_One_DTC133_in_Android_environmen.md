# How can I adjust the color temperature of Wacom One (DTC133) in Android environment?

The default value of color temperature is 6500K. Long press the power key for 6 seconds will turn the color temperature to 7500K. Other values can only be set in the Wacom driver via MacOS or Windows environment due to Android specifications. If no color change occurs, check for firmware updates in the Wacom Driver.
