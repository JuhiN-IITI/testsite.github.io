# How do I change the nib on the Wacom One Pen (CP91300B2Z)?

There are 3 spare nibs located underneath the built-in stand leg closest to the power button. Use the nib removal tool (hole next to the spare nibs) to remove your current nib. Then just gently push a new nib into your pen until it fits securely.
