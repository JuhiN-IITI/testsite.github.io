# Can I use my computer USB port to power the Wacom One (DTC133)?

While it may be technically possible to use a USB port to power the Wacom One, the Wacom One was not designed to be powered from your computer’s USB ports and such use may result in damage to your PC or the Wacom One itself.  The Wacom One was designed to be powered exclusively by plugging the Wacom One into a standard wall (AC) outlet, using the Wacom-supplied power adapter that accompanies the Wacom One.  Thus, the use of a USB port setup, while technically possible, is neither recommended nor supported by Wacom, and any defects or damage to the Wacom One as a result of such use are not covered by Wacom’s limited warranty.  If you use a USB port to power the Wacom One, you do so at your own risk and acknowledge and agree that: (i) such use may cause damage to your PC and/or your Wacom One; and (ii) Wacom will have no liability or responsibility to you in connection with any such use, including any resulting damage that may occur as a result of such use.  If you need to purchase a new or replacement Wacom-supplied power adapter to power your Wacom One, please visit our eStore and search for ACK44514.
