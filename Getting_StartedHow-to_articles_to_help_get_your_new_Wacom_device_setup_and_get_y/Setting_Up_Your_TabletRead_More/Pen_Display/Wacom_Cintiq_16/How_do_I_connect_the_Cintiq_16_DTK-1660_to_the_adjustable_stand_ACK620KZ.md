# How do I connect the Cintiq 16 (DTK-1660) to the adjustable stand (ACK620KZ)?

Place the display facedown on a flat, stable surface with a soft cloth between the display and the surface.
Attach the adapter plate with the included 4 (M4 x 6mm) screws to the tablet.
Attach the stand to the adapter plate with the included 4 (M3 x 5mm) screws in either a portrait or landscape position.
