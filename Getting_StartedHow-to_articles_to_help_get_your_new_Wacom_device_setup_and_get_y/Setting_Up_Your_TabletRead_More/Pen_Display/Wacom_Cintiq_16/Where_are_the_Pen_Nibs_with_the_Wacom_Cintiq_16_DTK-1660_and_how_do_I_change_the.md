# Where are the Pen Nibs with the Wacom Cintiq 16 (DTK-1660) and how do I change them?

The Wacom Cintiq 16 comes with a detachable pen holder. This holder also stores three replacement nibs and the nib removal tool. To change the nibs, remove the holder from the Cintiq. Insert the nib end of the pen into the removal hole on the holder. tilt the pen slightly and pull the pen away from the holder, pulling the nib with it. Slid out a new nib from the holder and insert into the pen using your finger.
