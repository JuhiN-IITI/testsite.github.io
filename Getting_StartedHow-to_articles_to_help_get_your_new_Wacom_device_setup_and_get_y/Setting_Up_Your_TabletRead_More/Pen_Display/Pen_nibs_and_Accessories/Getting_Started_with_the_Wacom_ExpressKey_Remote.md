# Getting Started with the Wacom ExpressKey Remote

Getting Started with the Wacom ExpressKey Remote


* Special note: When using more than one remote:


Since the release of driver version 6.3.31, the new Shared ExpressKey™ Remote Settings feature now allows for multiple attached ExpressKey™ to have the same settings.


If you wish for each ExpressKey Remote to work separate from each other, hence holding different preferences, all you need to do is change the name of the remotes to be different from each other.  To do this, please open "Wacom Tablet Properties" and double click on top of the EK Remote listed under "Device" at the top.  Once you rename your remote, that one will become independent from the other/s and hence you can now change preferences for each of the ones listed.
