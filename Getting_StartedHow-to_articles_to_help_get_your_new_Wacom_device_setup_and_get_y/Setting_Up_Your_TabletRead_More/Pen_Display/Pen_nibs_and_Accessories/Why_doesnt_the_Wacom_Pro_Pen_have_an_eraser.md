# Why doesn’t the Wacom Pro Pen have an eraser?

Most 3D applications require precise selecting of 3D elements to be erased. This is easier and more efficient with the narrow pen tip of the Wacom Pro Pen 3D, rather than a blunt eraser.


Set one of the pen buttons to the erase setting in the Wacom Tablet Properties to erase from the pen.
