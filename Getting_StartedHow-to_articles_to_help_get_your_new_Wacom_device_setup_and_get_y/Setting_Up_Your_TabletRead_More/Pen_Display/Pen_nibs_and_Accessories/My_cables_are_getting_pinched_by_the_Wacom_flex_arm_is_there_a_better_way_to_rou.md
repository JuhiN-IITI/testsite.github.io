# My cables are getting pinched by the Wacom flex arm, is there a better way to route them?

To avoid the potential of pinched cables, follow the cable routing instructions below:

Route all cables through the grommet holes and connect them to the Wacom Cintiq Pro.
Attach bracket to Cintiq Pro
Mount Cintiq Pro onto Flex Arm, following all instructions in the Quick Start Guide.
Tie the cables to the bottom of the arm using the pre-installed Velcro cable ties.
Make sure that the cables have enough slack to support the full range of motion of the arm.



Please review the Wacom Flex Arm Quick Start Guide that came with your arm for detailed installation instructions:
