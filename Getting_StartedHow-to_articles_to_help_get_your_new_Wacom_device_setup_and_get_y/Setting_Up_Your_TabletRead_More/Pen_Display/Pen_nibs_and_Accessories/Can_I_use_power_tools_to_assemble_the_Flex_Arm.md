# Can I use power tools to assemble the Flex Arm?

Electrical tools should not be used to mount the flexible arm or to attach the bracket to the Cintiq Pro. Power tools offer limited control and easily damage screw threads and heads. Please use the tools included in the flexible arm to install and uninstall it.
