# What’s the likelihood that the Cintiq Ergo Stand (accessory) for the Cintiq 27QHD will scratch the surface where it’s placed? How can I protect the surface?

To ensure you’re comfortable while working, both Cintiq 27QHD pen displays when attached to the optional Cintiq Ergo Stand are designed so you can slide them across your desk. However, this may scratch some surfaces. To prevent damage to your work surface, please avoid using the Cintiq 27QHD on delicate or easily damaged surfaces. Keeping the surface free from dust and other contaminants will help minimize the risk of scratching.
