# How do I adjust my Wacom Flex arm to stabilize my Cintiq Pro to my preferences?

To Increase/Decrease Arm Lift Strength:


If your Cintiq Pro is too heavy for the arm to hold it in the highest position, or too light and automatically rises from a low position, you need to adjust the arm lift strength:

Raise the arm to the highest position
Adjust the arm lift strength (many turns may be required)






To Increase/Decrease Display Tilt support


If your Cintiq Pro’s front edge does not stay up when raised, you'll need to tighten the screw under the display attachment. If your Cintiq Pro’s front edge does not to stay down, you need to loosen the screw.





To Increase/Decrease Friction:


If your Cintiq Pro moves from side to side to easily, you’ll need to tighten the screw on the top of the display attachment to the arm. If the friction is too tight, you’ll need to loosen the screw.
