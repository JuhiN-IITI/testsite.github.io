# Can I use the Wacom Pro Pen 3D together with touch input?

Yes. If you have a touch-enabled Wacom pen tablet or pen display, then you can use both touch input and pen input. Depending on the application and operating system that you are using, you may need to move the pen away from the tablet or pen display to use touch input.
