# What applications are supported by the Wacom Pro Pen 3D?

The Wacom Pro Pen 3D works with all applications, so you can use it to draw, write, and express yourself in your favorite programs.


The default settings Pan/Zoom and Tumble will emulate the applications’ pan, zoom & tumble tools in the following 3D applications:

Pixelogic Z-Brush
Pixelogic Z-Brush Core
Dassault Systèmes Solidworks*
Autodesk Fusion 360
Autodesk Maya
Autodesk Maya LT
Autodesk Inventor
Autodesk Alias Design
Autodesk Alias Surface
Autodesk Alias Autostudio
Autodesk 3D Studio Max
Autodesk Mudbox
Maxon Cinema 4D
Foundry Modo
Rhino



Note: For Solidworks 2017 and older, deselect the “Use Windows Ink” option in the Pen - Mapping tab of the Wacom Tablet Properties.


In other applications:

Pressing a button set to Pan/Zoom sends vertical & horizontal scroll messages when the pen tip is hovering, and Ctrl + vertical scroll messages when the pen tip is touching the tablet. Each applications response to these messages may vary.
Pressing a button set to Tumble will send a Middle Click. Each applications response to the middle click may vary.



If a default setting does not work in your application, change the setting to suit your personal workflow and needs. All settings are customizable in Wacom Tablet Properties, accessible from the Wacom Desktop Center or the operating system’s settings controls.


Tip: Set different settings for different applications by using Application Specific Settings. This allows you to use different shortcuts or modifier-clicks for your favorite applications.


Information about setting and using Application Specific Settings is available in the User Help for your product (also accessible from the Wacom Desktop Center and the Wacom Tablet Properties).
