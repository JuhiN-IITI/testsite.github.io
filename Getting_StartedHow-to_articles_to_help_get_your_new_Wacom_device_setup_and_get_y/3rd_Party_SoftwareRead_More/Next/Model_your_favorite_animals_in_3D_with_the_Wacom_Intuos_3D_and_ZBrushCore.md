# Model your favorite animals in 3D with the Wacom Intuos 3D and ZBrushCore

Explore all of your creativity in 3D! With the Intuos 3D and ZBrushCore by Pixologic, you can model, sculpt and print just about anything that you can think of. Intuos 3d is the combination of a pressure sensitive Intuos pen tablet and z-brush core software with online training.


Creating models with Intuos 3d is like modeling with digital clay. It is easy to establish the basic shape of your model with insert mesh brushes. These objects can be moved and shaped independently and then merged into one solid form.


Insert meshes can also be separated into different sub-tools. Each sub-tool can be worked on separately without affecting the other parts. Z-brush Core contains a wide variety of sculpting brushes that mimic interacting with real world clay. Add, subtract, carve and sculpt with the help of the Intuos pen and tablet.


You can create different forms and shapes starting from a simple sphere. Tools in the software will take care of the details, allowing you to create without limitations. The mirror feature allows you sculpt on just one side of the model, saving time by not having to worry about creating both sides of an object.


Thin shapes can be created with extractions. Draw out a shape with the masking brush and the extract feature will create a new mesh. Many of the sculpting tools use pressure sensitivity, meaning the harder you press, the more effect the sculpting tool has on the model.


The masking brush is also useful in sculpting. It is used to protect areas of the model or help create specific shapes.


Rotational mirroring helps in creating decorative designs, then the clay polish feature can be used to create crisp forms and sharp edges. Move, rotate, and scale tools allow you to shape and pose the model. They are useful for repositioning objects and making large changes.


For 3d printing, the model can be hollowed out with the shell command, saving material and making the print less expensive. There are also tools that optimize the mesh to prepare it for 3d printing. The model can then be exported in industry standard file formats.
