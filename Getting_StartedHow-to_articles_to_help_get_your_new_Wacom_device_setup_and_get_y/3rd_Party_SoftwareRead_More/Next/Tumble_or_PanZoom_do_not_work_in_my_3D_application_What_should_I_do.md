# Tumble or Pan/Zoom do not work in my 3D application. What should I do?

First make sure you have the latest available driver. Open the Wacom Desktop Center and select the Update tab, then follow the instructions to install all available updates.
Review a Youtube video to make sure you understand how these functions are designed to work.
“Pan/Zoom” and “Tumble” are currently supported for the following applications: 
  
Pixelogic Z-Brush
Pixelogic Z-Brush Core
Dassault Systèmes Solidworks*
Autodesk Fusion 360
Autodesk Maya
Autodesk Maya LT
Autodesk Inventor
Autodesk Alias Design
Autodesk Alias Surface
Autodesk Alias Autostudio
Autodesk 3D Studio Max
Autodesk Mudbox
Maxon Cinema 4D
Foundry Modo
Rhino
 



Note: For Solidworks 2017 and older, deselect the “Use Windows Ink” option in the Pen - Mapping tab of the Wacom Tablet Properties.

In other applications, Tumble and/or Pan/Zoom do not work or may result in unexpected results. To get the most of your pen in those applications, assign custom settings in Wacom Tablet Properties. Wacom suggests the following settings for 3D applications: 
  
For the front button, select Keyboard > Modifiers and assign the appropriate inputs to activate the Tumble or Rotate function of your 3D application.
For the middle button, select Keyboard > Modifiers and assign the appropriate inputs to activate either the Pan or the Zoom function of your 3D application (depending on your workflow).
 



Tip: Set different settings for different applications by using Application Specific Settings. This allows you to use different shortcuts or modifier-clicks for your favorite applications.

Information about setting and using Application Specific Settings is available in the User Help for your product (also accessible from the Wacom Desktop Center and the Wacom Tablet Properties).
