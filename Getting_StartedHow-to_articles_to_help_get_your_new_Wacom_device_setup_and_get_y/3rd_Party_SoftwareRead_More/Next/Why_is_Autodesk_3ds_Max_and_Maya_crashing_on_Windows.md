# Why is Autodesk 3ds Max and Maya crashing on Windows?

As of January 19, 2023, we have identified an issue which causes Autodesk software -3ds Max and MAYA - to crash while using the Wacom tablet driver ver 6.4.*


We are currently working with Autodesk to identify the causes and provide a solution. 


In the meantime, a viable workaround is to uninstall the current driver and install driver 6.4.0-11
