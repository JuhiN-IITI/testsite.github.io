# Tumble and Pan/Zoom do not work in my 2D application. What should I do?

Tumble is a 3D function that does not exist in 2D applications. The button will emulate a middle mouse button in 2D applications (which supports scrolling in many applications).
In most 2D applications, a button set to Pan/Zoom sends vertical & horizontal scroll messages when the pen tip is hovering, and Ctrl + vertical scroll messages when the pen tip is touching the tablet (which will pan and zoom if the applications supports those messages).
Please change the pen button settings in Wacom Tablet Properties to optimize your workflow. 
  
Tip: Set different settings for different applications by using Application Specific Settings. This allows you to use different shortcuts or modifier-clicks for your favorite applications.
 
Information about setting and using Application Specific Settings is available in the User Help for your product (also accessible from the Wacom Desktop Center and the Wacom Tablet Properties).
