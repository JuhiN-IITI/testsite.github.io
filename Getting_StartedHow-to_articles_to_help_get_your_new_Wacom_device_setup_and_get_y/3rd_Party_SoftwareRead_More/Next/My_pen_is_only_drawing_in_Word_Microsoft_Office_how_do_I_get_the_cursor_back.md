# My pen is only drawing in Word (Microsoft Office) how do I get the cursor back?

When using a pen tool, like the pen that comes with a Wacom tablet, Windows turns on the “Pen and Touch” features in the operating system. Part of this feature is called Windows Ink, this part recognized the pen being used as a pen instead of a standard mouse and automatically changes the cursor to the pen tool.


To change the cursor back to a mouse cursor. Select the “Draw tab” on the menu bar. Next click the “Select” tool, which also looks like the mouse cursor. The pen will now select like a normal mouse cursor.


This setting can be changed in Excel, Word, OneNote, and PowerPoint the same way as described above.
