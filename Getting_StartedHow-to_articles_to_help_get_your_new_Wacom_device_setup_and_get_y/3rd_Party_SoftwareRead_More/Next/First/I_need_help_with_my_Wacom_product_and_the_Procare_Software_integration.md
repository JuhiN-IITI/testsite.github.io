# I need help with my Wacom product and the Procare Software integration

An integration does exist as of this writing (mid-2024), however Procare undertook the integration themselves with our Wacom STU-model signature pads. Many software issues can be interpreted as a hardware issue "false positive", so if you run into issues it could be related to the configuration or a step was missed, etc. They can also confirm which specific devices are compatible.


The first step is to contact Procare Software for assistance if you have not already done so. Here are some resources:


support@procaresoftware.com

The Wacom Customer Care and Business Solutions teams can troubleshoot hardware issues with the STU devices themselves outside of the integration.
