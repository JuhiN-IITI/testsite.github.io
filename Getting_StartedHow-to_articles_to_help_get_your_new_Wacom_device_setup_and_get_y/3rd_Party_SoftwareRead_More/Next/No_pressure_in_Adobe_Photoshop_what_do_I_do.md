# No pressure in Adobe Photoshop, what do I do?

If pen pressure is not working in Adobe Photoshop, this can be caused by a few incorrect settings in Photoshop, a driver issue, or a windows ink issue. Follow the instructions below:

Check to make sure pressure is turned on in Photoshop.

Open the program and open a new document.
Select the brush tool
Press the F5 key on the keyboard, this will open the brush pallet window. The brush pallet window can also be opened by going to View on the menu bar and selecting brush pallet.
In the brush pallet window, select “Shape Dynamics” and make sure the selection box is checked in for this section. Under the “Jitter” section, use the dropdown menu next to control to select “Pen Pressure.”








 

If you have a triangle with a “!” in it next to the pen pressure option. Please uninstall and reinstall the Wacom driver following the steps linked below for your operating system.

If the issue continues after these steps, please make sure to turn Windows Ink on, as Photoshop needs Windows Ink to be activated for pressure to work correctly. Please see the guide:  Wacom Tablet Support FAQ
