# Does the nib wear down on the Bamboo Fineline (3rd gen) or the Bamboo Fineline 2?

You can draw more than 100 km (60 mi) of lines with the Bamboo Fineline (3rd gen) or the Bamboo Fineline 2 on an iPad or iPhone screen. Under most circumstances, the nib will provide months of use, however, if the nib is wearing faster than expected, try using less pressure when writing and drawing. Replacement nibs can be purchased online at the Wacom Store. For accessories and other product options, go to Wacom.com and click on "Store."
