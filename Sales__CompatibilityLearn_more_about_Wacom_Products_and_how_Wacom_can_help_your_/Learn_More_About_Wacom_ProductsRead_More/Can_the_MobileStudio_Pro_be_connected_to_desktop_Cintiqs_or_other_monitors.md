# Can the MobileStudio Pro be connected to desktop Cintiqs or other monitors?

Yes. The MobileStudio Pro has a USB-C connector which supports Thunderbolt 3 connection to other USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 devices. For connection to other devices that donâ€™t support USB-C Thunderbolt 3 connection, you will need an extra adaptor.

If your MobileStudio Pro has model number DTH-W1320 or DTH-W1620 you can also use the Wacom Link adaptor - ACK42719. This is not compatible with other versions of MobileStudio Pro.
NOTE: The Wacom Link Plus - ACK42819 - cannot be used to output a video signal so it cannot be used to connect an external monitor to the MobileStudio Pro.
