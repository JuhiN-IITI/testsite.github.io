# How can a tablet increase efficiency?

In order to increase your efficiency, the Cintiq and Intuos feature the ExpressKeys and Touch Strips or Touch Rings which allows you to reduce keyboard usage and to concentrate on the Cintiq and Intuos as you main working tool.

The ExpressKeys have the most important menu commands already preset, but are freely programmable by yourself.
The Touch Strip is perfect to scroll and zoom in your documents.
Both programmable elements are located on each side to suit both left- and right-handers equally.



To cut a long story short: the interaction between pens, ExpressKeys and Touch Strips / Touch Rings minimizes keyboard usage, accelerates your workflow and enhances your efficiency and productivity.
