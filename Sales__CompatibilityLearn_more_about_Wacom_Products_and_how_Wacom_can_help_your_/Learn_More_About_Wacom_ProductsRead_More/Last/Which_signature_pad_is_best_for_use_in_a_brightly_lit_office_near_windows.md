# Which signature pad is best for use in a brightly lit office, near windows?

All monochrome STU signature pads use transreflective screens, which means that ambient light controls the brightness of the screen. The brighter the room lighting, the brighter the display becomes. Backlit displays are better for viewing in rooms that are not as bright, as they have their own light source to make the display visible. All Wacom color signature pads and pen displays are backlit.
