# What are Wacom Refurbished Devices?

Wacom Refurbished Devices are pre-owned Wacom products that have been subjected to Wacom’s standard refurbishment process prior to being offered for sale or used as a warranty replacement.


Wacom’s standard refurbishment process includes the inspection, cleaning and repair of any technical issues (only some of the refurbished devices were returned due to technical issues) so as to ensure that the device meets Wacom’s rigorous quality standards. Only devices that satisfy a final quality assurance inspection are made available for sale as a Wacom Refurbished Device. However, Wacom Refurbished Devices may show slight signs of wear, and may or may not be in their original packaging.
