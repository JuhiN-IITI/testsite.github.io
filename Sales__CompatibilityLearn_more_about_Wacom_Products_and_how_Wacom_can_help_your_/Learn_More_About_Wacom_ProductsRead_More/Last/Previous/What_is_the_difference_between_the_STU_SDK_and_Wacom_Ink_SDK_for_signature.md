# What is the difference between the STU SDK and Wacom Ink SDK for signature?

The Wacom Ink SDK for signature provides a high level, cross device API for capturing handwritten signatures from a Wacom signature device. The SDK simplifies interaction with Wacom pen tablets and provides an API to capture, manage, and display signatures. The STU SDK only works with the STU series of signature pads - it gives direct access to the pen data but does not provide any assistance with user interface design.
