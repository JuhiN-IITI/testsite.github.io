# What is the difference between Wacom Intuos Pro (2017) and Intuos Pro (2013)?

Wacom Intuos Pro is a technical evolution of Intuos 5 combined with innovative on-paper capture features.


We completely redesigned the core pen technology. Now our new pen generation provides 4x the pressure levels, reduced latency, lower activation force to bring creative expression to a whole new level.


But what about the tablets? We combined glassfibre-reinforced resin with anodized aluminum to make them strong, durable but also thin, clean and premium. Now the Wacom Intuos Pro tablets are 4mm thinner â€“ 8mm instead 12mm. And they are more compact than ever: the L size tablet is 20% smaller, the M size tablet is appr. 39% smaller and the S size tablet is appr. 31% smaller.


The active areas are covered with a texture sheet which can be replaced. Two different texture options are available as an accessory for the Medium and Large sizes to customize the pen feel on the tablet.


The Micro-USB connector has been replaced by a reversible USB-C connector. The USB cable is stronger and PVC-free. All Wacom Intuos Pro tablets are now wireless using latest Bluetooth technology.


Additional differences apply to Wacom Intuos Pro in M and L size only: a Finetip pen with gel ink and a Ballpoint Pen with oil ink are available to sketch on paper and capture in the built-in memory, including layers. The Paper Clip will hold up to 10 sheets of paper securely. These can be purchased separately or as the Paper Edition. A new version of Wacom Inkspace completes the experience and allows to export sketches to PSD, SVG, PNG, JPG or WILL formats, organize and share content and visually work together. It works on Mac, Windows, iOS and Android devices and allows for Wacom Cloud synchronization.
