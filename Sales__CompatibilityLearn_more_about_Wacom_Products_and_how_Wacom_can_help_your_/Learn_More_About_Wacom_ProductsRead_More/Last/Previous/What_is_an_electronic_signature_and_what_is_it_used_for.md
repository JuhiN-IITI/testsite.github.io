# What is an electronic signature and what is it used for?

A handwritten signature establishes a clear link between a written document and its author. An electronic signature is used to assign an electronic document to its originator, or to indicate consent by the contracting parties. A qualified signature also safeguards a documentâ€™s authenticity (is the document actually from whom it says it is?) and integrity (has the document been changed at any time during the transmission process?).
