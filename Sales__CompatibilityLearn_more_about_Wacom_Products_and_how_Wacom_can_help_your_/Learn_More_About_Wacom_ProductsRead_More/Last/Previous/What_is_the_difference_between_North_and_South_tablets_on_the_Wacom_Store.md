# What is the difference between North and South tablets on the Wacom Store?

While browsing the Wacom estore, you may find two of the same products of the same model the designation "North" or "South" at the end.


The only difference between the two models is the packaging and product instructions. Â 

Devices labeled North have text translations for English, German, French, Dutch, and Russian.
Devices labeled South have text translations for English, French, Spanish, and Italian.



Other than the Text translations on the packaging, there is no difference between the two products.
