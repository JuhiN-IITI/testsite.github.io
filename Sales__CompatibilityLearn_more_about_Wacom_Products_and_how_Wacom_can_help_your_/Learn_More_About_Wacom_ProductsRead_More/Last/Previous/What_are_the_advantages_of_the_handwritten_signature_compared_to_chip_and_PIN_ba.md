# What are the advantages of the handwritten signature compared to chip and PIN based methods?

There are several important advantages to utilizing handwritten signatures instead of chip and pin systems, including:


- An individual's signature cannot be lost or stolen like a card can - It is impossible to forget one's signature, unlike a PIN


- Signatures cannot be disclosed to third parties


- Signatures are always given deliberately, where cards and disclosed PINs may be used without consent


- Signatures are considered suitable for authenticating declarations of intent


- Signing with a pen is a familiar and customary process
