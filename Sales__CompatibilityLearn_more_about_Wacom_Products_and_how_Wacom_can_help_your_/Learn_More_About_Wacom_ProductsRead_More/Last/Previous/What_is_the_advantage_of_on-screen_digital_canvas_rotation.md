# What is the advantage of on-screen digital canvas rotation?

In supporting applications digital canvas rotation combined with multi-touch allows the user to not only rotate, but also to quickly switch to panning and zooming the canvas. In addition, when using digital canvas rotation, the user interface does not rotate so all menus and on-screen items remain easy to read.
