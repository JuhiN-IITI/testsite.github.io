# What are the advantages of handwritten electronic signatures?

Handwritten electronic signatures can help businesses deliver seamless paperless workflows for in-person transactions. They can also help deliver:


- Reduced process costs thanks to shorter processing and throughput times for electronic documents


- More efficient workflows thanks to continuous process chains all the way from creation to archiving of media


- Reduced operating costs and outlay on consumables for printing and copying


- Savings on the investment, maintenance and administration of scanning solutions for document archiving


- Savings on the production, storage and paper logistics of pre-printed forms


- Improved security through a certified signature process


- Flexibility to accommodate last-minute changes to standard forms, e.g. revision of bank account details or General Terms and Conditions
