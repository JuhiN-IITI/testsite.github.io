# What is Mapping?

The mapping defines the aspect ratio between the vertical and horizontal dimension of the tablet or display. The Mapping tab in the Wacom driver defines how the tablet area is mapped to the display area. This setting determines if the aspect of the tablet and display are the same. It also determines if a 1:1 scale will be maintained between the tablet and display.
