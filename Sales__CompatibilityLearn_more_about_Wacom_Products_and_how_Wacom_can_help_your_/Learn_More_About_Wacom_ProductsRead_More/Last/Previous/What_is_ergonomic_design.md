# What is ergonomic design?

Ergonomic design enables a natural feeling during signing. This is caused by the pad design as well as the pen design. These are built to comfortably fit in the hand of a wide variety of people. The pad design is smooth, low profile, with no hard edges that can cause discomfort to the hand when signing or filling out eForms.
