# What is the optimal pen proximity to ensure that my pen is detected?

Pen proximity refers to the height above the pen display active area where the pen is detected. Typical proximity is 5mm, and your pen should be detected at this distance. There is no specification for maximum proximity, and some pens may be detected at 10mm, or even 20 mm, although this varies for different combinations of pen and tablet.
