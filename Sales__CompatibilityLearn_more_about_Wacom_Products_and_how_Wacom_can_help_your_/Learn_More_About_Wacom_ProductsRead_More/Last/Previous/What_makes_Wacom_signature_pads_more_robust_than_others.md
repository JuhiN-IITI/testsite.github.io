# What makes Wacom signature pads more robust than others?

One factor is that the sensor is embedded under the surface, protected by a strong layer of glass. Scratches, temperature and humidity cannot reach the sensor, making it more durable. Other vendors often use resistive touch technology, which requires a screen surface that is flexible. It is not possible to protect the sensor surface with glass or other hard material. The surfaces of such devices have a very limited lifetime and wear-out quickly with normal use. Wacom's signature pads have a very robust surface and our warranty includes the screen surface for normal use. Another factor is that Wacomâ€™s patented electro-magnetic resonance technology allows for our electronic pen to be powered and communicate wirelessly, so there are no wires or cords to twist and break, which is a common failure of other signature pads.
