# What are the possibilities available for electronic handwritten signatures?

Document scanners use CCD sensors to read the image of a handwritten signature as colour and brightness information of individual pixels. The signature is recorded as static image information only. The appearance of a signature alone is not a secure criterion, because the individual dynamic parameters of the signature are missing. Signature pads take security to the next level by analysing the signature as it is handwritten on a sensor panel using a special pen.
In addition to the appearance of the signature, they record biometric parameters such as acceleration, pressure progression and the angle of the pen while signing, thereby producing a kind of a "digital fingerprint". This fingerprint is as individual and unique as its owner, and together with a digital certificate, is today the safest method of reading electronic signatures.
