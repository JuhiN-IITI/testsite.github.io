# What is the Bamboo Slate or Bamboo Folio and how does it work?

The Bamboo Slate is a smart notebook that empowers you to digitally capture your ideas while you write with pen on any paper. Push a button and your handwritten notes are transferred to the Wacom Inkspace app on your smartphone or tablet (BluetoothÂ® Smart Ready devices with Android or iOS). Sync your files with Inkspace to easily access your ideas on other devices for editing, collaborating, sharing and organizing. Within the Wacom Cloud your content stays editable thanks to the WILL universal ink. Use the Bamboo Paper app to further edit your ideas in iOS or Android. Also export to Dropbox, Evernote, and other 3rd party apps.
