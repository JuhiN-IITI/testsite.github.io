# What size of Signature Pad should I choose?

It depends on the amount of text you wish to display, and if you want to display soft-keys for actions such as Clear, Cancel, or Accept. To display full documents, scroll up or down, and sign on the screen on the document itself, the DTU-1031X, DTU-1141, DTH-1152 or a larger pen displays would be ideal.
