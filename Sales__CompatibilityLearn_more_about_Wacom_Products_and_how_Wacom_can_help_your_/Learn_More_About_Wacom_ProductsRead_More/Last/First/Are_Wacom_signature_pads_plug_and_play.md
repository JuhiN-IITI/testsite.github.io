# Are Wacom signature pads plug and play?

No, in order to capture signatures on any Wacom device, you will need a compatible eSignature software from either Wacom or one of our partners. Wacom's sign pro PDF software is an ideal solution for customers looking to integrate electronic signatures but are not currently utilizing software from a third party or one of our partners.
