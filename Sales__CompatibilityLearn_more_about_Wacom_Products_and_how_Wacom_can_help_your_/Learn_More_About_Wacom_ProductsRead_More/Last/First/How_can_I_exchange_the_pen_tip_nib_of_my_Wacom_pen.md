# How can I exchange the pen tip (nib) of my Wacom pen?

Your pen tip (which we refer to as a "nib") will wear with normal use. Usage time varies depending on the amount of pressure you apply to apply to the pen. If your nib develops a flat point or sharp edges, we recommend that you change it. Replacement nibs are packaged with your tablet, with additional nibs available for purchase from the Wacom Store.
 
 Instructions for replacing your nib:

To begin, clasp the old nib with the nib extraction tool (delivered with most of our current tablets), and pull it straight out of the pen.
If you don’t have nib extraction tool, small piers will work sufficiently.
Insert the new nib straight into the pen and tap the pen down lightly to ensure it’s in place.
