# Can the pen nibs I have purchased for a previous generation pen be used with the Pro Pen 2?

No, the Pro Pen 2 uses a new nib design and size. Nibs for previous pens are not compatible with new Pro Pen 2 included with the Wacom Cintiq Pro. Replacement pen nibs (Standard: ACK22201 (5 pack) or ACK22211 (10 pack) or Felt: ACK22203 (5 pack) or ACK22213 (10 pack)) can be purchased from the Wacom eStore.
