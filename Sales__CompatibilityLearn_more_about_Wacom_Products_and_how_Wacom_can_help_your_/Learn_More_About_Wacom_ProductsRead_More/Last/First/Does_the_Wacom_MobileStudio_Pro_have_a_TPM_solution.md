# Does the Wacom MobileStudio Pro have a TPM solution?

Yes. The Wacom MobileStudio Pro (enhanced) will come with a firmware-based TPM, instead of an IC TPM. This is not a physical TPM module, but is part of the CPU architecture. From a security standpoint, discrete and firmware TPM solutions share the same characteristics:


혺 Both use hardware based secure execution.


혺 Both use firmware for portions of the TPM functionality.


혺 Both are equipped with tamper resistance capabilities.


혺 Both have unique security limitations/risks.
