# Does Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100x, CTL-6100x, CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx) offer multi-touch?

Wacom Intuos does not offer multi-touch on any of the new models (CTL-4100K, CTL-4100WLK, CTL-4100WLP, CTL-4100WLE, CTL-6100, CTL-6100WLK, CTL-6100WLP, CTL-6100WLE). Most users did not find the feature relevant or useful. Instead, we added wireless capability (in the Bluetooth models), which gives you more flexibility to design your optimum workspace.
