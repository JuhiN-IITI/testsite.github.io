# Does Wacom signature pads work out-of-the-box?

Wacom STU signature pads require supporting software in order to function. Wacom sign pro PDF works with all Wacom signature pads and pen displays, as does eSignature software from our partners such as SoftPro and XYZMo. If you are a developer and want to integrate eSignature functionality into your application, then you can request the necessary Software Developer Kits from Wacom.
