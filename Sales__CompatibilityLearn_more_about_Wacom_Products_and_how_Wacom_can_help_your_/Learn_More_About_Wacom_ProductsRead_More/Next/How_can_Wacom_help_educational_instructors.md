# How can Wacom help educational instructors?

Wacom's range of interactive pen displays makes it easy for educators and other presenters to share ideas and emphasize key concepts by working directly on screen to mark up and annotate digital content. All Wacom's interactive displays are software-neutral and can be used with your preferred software applications on either a Mac or Windows system. The pen can be used to control the cursor just like a mouse, and when sharing lesson plans, educators can utilize software applications like Microsoft Powerpoint, whiteboard applications and other screen annotation software to communicate visually.
