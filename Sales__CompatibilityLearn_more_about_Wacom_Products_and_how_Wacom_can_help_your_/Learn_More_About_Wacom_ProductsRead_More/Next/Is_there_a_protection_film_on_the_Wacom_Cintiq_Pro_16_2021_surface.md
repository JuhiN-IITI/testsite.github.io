# Is there a protection film on the Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (2021) surface?

No, the Cintiq Pro 16 does not use a protection film that may wear off over time. To provide the best screen quality, writing feeling, and anti-reflection drawing surface, Wacom designed and manufactured the new Wacom Cintiq ProÂ with a durable etched glass surface for long term use in your creative workflow.
