# How do you use a Wacom Pen?

Using the Pen.

Use your pen to interact with your device to draw, write, or move items and to perform the settings that you assign to pen buttons.
Hold the pen as you would normally hold a pen or pencil. Adjust your grip so that you can press any pen buttons easily with your thumb (recommended) or index finger without accidentally pressing it. See the tutorial here.




Using the pen tip and eraser.

Draw or sign: Draw or sign with the pen tip directly on the device surface.
Pens are pressure-sensitive, so the harder you press, the thicker your lines and the denser the color.
Move the cursor: Move the pen while holding it slightly above the device without touching the screen surface.
Double-click: Quickly tap the screen twice in the same place with the pen tip.
Erase: Flip the pen to the side opposite the pen tip and move the eraser over the area you want to erase, just as you would use the eraser on a pencil. (Note: Some pens do not have an eraser.)
Select an item: Tap the screen once with the pen tip.
Move an item: Select the item with the pen tip, then slide the pen tip across the screen to move it.



Using pen buttons. Note: Some pens do not have any buttons.

See the pen button set up video here.

Use pen buttons as shortcuts to settings. To activate settings, hold the pen tip slightly above the surface of your device and press the button.
You do not have to touch the pen tip to the surface to use the button.
To see what settings are assigned to the button, look on the Pen tab in Wacom Tablet Properties. You can change the settings that are assigned any time you want.
If your pen has a long, thin button, press the upper part of the button for one setting and the lower part for another.
