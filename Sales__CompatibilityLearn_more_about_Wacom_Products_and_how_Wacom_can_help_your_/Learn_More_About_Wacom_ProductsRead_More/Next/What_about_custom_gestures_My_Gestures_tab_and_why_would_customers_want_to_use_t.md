# What about custom gestures (My Gestures tab) and why would customers want to use them?

To meet individual workflow preferences users can create their own shortcuts by customizing gestures or by using those that Wacom recommends. It’s similar to setting up custom ExpressKeys. For example, one time-savings gesture could bring up Painter and Photoshop shortcuts such as Show/Hide all panels.


Customization depends both on the operating system and the application that the customer is using. To turn off these capabilities in Windows select “Use Windows gestures” on the touch options tab. Download the Wacom Gesture Guide by clicking here.
