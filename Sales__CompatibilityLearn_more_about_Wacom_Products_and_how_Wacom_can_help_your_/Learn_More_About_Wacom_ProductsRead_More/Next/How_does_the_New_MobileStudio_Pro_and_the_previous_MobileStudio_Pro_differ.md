# How does the New MobileStudio Pro and the previous MobileStudio Pro differ?

As successor for the current Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 the new generation is providing state of the art components like the NVIDIA® Quadro® P1000 graphics power, the latest Intel Core i7 - 8559U processor and Thunderbolt connectivity which makes it powerful enough to run full creative applications anytime anywhere. It also includes the detachable Wacom Stand which allows you to set the MobileStudio Pro on a flat surface at 3 different angles. Additionally, we have introduced a new backdoor feature: You can now upgrade your SSD and RAM.
