# Does the Bamboo Stylus feel work with other Wacom products?

The Bamboo Stylus feel does not work with our Intuos, Cintiq and Bamboo tablet products, as they’re specifically designed to record creative expression, and therefore use a different pen technology.Select products from our Wacom business solutions line were designed using our feel IT pen technology. We’re currently testing these products, and they’ll be added to the compatibility list as soon as results are available.


Older products based on Wacom pen-enabled technology will work with the Bamboo Stylus feel, as their technologies are generally compatible. However, there are some differences in the sensor integration, which may cause a different pen-on-screen performance, depending on the product. The most noticeable difference is a small offset of the pen positioning, when compared with the pen was packaged with the device.
