# Do the Intuos 5 and Intuos Pro pens work with Wacom Intuos Pro (2017) products? What about the replacement pen nibs?

Yes, some of the Intuos 5 and Pro pens are compatible. The Grip Pen(KP501E2), Classic Pen(KP300E2), Art Pen(KP701E2), Airbrush (KP400E2), and Pro Pen(KP503E) are compatible with the Wacom Intuos Pro (2017) tablets. However, the new Pens like Pro Pen 2, Finetip Pen and Ballpoint Pen require new replacement pen nibs. The Inking Pen is not compatible.
