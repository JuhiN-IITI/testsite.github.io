# Does the Wacom Intuos pen tablet work with an iPhone or iPad?

No, the Wacom Intuos pen tablet does not work with iPhones or iPads. It is designed to be used with computers running Windows or macOS.


However, Wacom does offer other products, such as the Bamboo Ink and Bamboo Sketch, that are specifically designed for use with iOS devices.
