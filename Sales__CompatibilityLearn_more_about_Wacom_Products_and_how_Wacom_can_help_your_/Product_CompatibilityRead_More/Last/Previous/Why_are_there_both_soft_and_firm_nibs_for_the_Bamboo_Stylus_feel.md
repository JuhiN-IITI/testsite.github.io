# Why are there both soft and firm nibs for the Bamboo Stylus feel?

Understanding that you use your pen for various unique writing and drawing tasks, weâ€™ve designed two distinct pen nibs that can be easily exchanged based on your design preference. The soft nib consists of a combination of rubberized and firm material, which allows for very smooth on-screen operation, while the firm nib enables you to write with firmer pressure, which is especially helpful on screens that have a textured protection foil.
