# Which devices work with Bamboo Ink?

The Bamboo Ink works on Windows devices with Wacom Active Electrostatic technology (AES) and/or Microsoft Pen Protocol (MPP). In general, the integration of the Bamboo Ink will vary slightly depending on your hardware configuration and system software installed. For this reason, we only include devices which have been tested on the list of compatible equipment, which is updated on a regular basis.
 For more information and a list of compatible devices, please visit our compatibility page: http://www.wacom.com/comp.
 Note: Bamboo Ink is not compatible with Apple products.
