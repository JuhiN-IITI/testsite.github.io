# Where can I purchase Inkling ballpoint pen refills?

Inkling uses standard mini ballpoint refills with a 1mm ball size; you can purchase these cartridges from most office supply retailers. Replacement cartridges are also available from various third-party vendors, in various ball sizes (0.8mm, 1.0mm, 1.2mm) and colors (black, blue, red & green). Wacom also supplies standard ballpoint pen refills called "MiniStar," manufactured by the Swiss company StarMines, for your Inkling.
