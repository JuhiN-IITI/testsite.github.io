# What are the accessory pens I can use with the Wacom Cintiq Pro?

All existing previous generation accessory pens (Pro Pen, Grip Pen, Art Pen, Classic Pen, Airbrush Pen) are compatible with the new Wacom Cintiq Pro pen display. Performance of these pens will be at the level as used on the previous generation of Cintiq pen displays.
