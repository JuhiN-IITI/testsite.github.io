# Where I can find replacement nibs for my Wacom Cintiq Pro?

The Wacom Cintiq Pro ships with 10 spare nibs; 6 black standard nibs which are the same as the nib that came in your Pro Pen 2, and 4 white felt nibs. You can find these spare nibs inside the underside of the circular pen stand. For additional assistance in opening the pen stand, please refer to your Quick Start Guide.
