# Which Chrome OS is supported and how can I check the kernel version of my Chromebook?

Chrome OS 87 and later, and Kernel version 4 and later(including 4.4, 4.14 and 4.19). To find out what version of the Kernel you are running, follow the steps below.

Press CTRL+ALT+T at the desktop or in the browser to open a terminal
Type in uname -r to get the full kernel version (e.g. 4.4.237). We typically only refer to a kernel by the first two components of its version (e.g. 4.4).
