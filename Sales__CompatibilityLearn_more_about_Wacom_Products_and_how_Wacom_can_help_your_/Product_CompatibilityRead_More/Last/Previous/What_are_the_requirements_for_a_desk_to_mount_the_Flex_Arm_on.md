# What are the requirements for a desk to mount the Flex Arm on?

The desk plate must have an edge at the back of the desk where the desk clamp can be attached (at least 120mm (4.7in.) wide). It is imperative that the mounting surface is strong enough to support the mounted Flex Arm and Cintiq Pro. For wood-based surfaces, a thickness of 25mm (1in.) to 66mm (2.5in.) is recommended.
