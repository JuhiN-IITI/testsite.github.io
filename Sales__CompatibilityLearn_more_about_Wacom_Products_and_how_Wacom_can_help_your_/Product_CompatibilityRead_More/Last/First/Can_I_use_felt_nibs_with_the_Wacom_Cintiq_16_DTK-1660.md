# Can I use felt nibs with the Wacom Cintiq 16 (DTK-1660)?

We strongly recommend against using felt nibs with the Wacom Cintiq 16 due to the risk of scratching the glass surface. The Standard Pen Nibs for the Wacom Pro Pen 2 are the only recommended pen nib. The part number is ACK22211 for a pack of 10 nibs.
