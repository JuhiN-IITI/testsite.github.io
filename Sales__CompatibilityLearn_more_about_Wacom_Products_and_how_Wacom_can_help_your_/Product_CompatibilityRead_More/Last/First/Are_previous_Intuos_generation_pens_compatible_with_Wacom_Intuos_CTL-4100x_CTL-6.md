# Are previous Intuos generation pens compatible with Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100x, CTL-6100x, CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx)?

No, previous generation Intuos pens are not compatible with the Wacom Intuos. The Wacom Intuos uses an improved version of Wacomâ€™s pen technology, which is not compatible with pens from earlier Intuos models.


The compatible pen for the Wacom Intuos is the Intuos 4K pen (LP-1100K).
