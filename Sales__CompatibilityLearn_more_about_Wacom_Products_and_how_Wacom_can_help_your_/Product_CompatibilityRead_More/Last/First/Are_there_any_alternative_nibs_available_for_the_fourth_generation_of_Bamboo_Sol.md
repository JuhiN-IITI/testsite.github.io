# Are there any alternative nibs available for the fourth generation of Bamboo Solo and Bamboo Duo?

Currently, there are no alternative nibs available for the fourth generation of Bamboo Solo and Bamboo Duo. We feel that we have created the best possible pen experience with the carbon fiber nib (6mm diameter). Nevertheless, Wacom has always made a strong point of listening to customer needs and following their requirements, so if in time we note a customer demand for a thinner nib, we will definitely look into this option: our job is to provide what users want.
