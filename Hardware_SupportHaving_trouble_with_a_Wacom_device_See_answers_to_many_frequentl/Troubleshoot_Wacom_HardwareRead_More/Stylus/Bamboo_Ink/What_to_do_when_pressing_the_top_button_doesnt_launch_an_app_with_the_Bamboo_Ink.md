# What to do when pressing the top button doesn’t launch an app with the Bamboo Ink

Make sure your Bamboo Ink is paired to your device. You can check from the Windows Start menu, select Settings> Devices > Bluetooth®. If pressing the top button still doesn’t launch the app, you might need to update the Wacom Tablet PC driver on your device. Please visit support.wacom.com and after you have selected your region, go to the Drivers section and follow the steps to update your driver.
