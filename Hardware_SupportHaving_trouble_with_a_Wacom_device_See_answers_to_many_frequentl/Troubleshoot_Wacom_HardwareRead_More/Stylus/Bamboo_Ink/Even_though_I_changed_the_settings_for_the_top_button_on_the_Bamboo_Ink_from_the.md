# Even though I changed the settings for the top button on the Bamboo Ink from the Windows Settings, it still doesn’t launch the app I selected. What do I need to do?

Reboot your device and make sure your Bamboo Ink is paired to this one. You can check from the Windows Start menu, select Settings> Devices > Bluetooth®. If pressing the top button still doesn’t launch the app, you might need to update the WacomTablet PC driver on your device. Please visit support.wacom.com and after you have selected your region, go to the Drivers section and follow the steps to update your driver.
