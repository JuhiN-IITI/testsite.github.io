# I experience a gap or offset between the tip of my Bamboo Fineline (3rd gen), Bamboo Fineline 2, or original Bamboo Stylus Fineline and the line on the screen. How can I avoid this?

Only Wacom stylus-compatible apps can properly correct this offset, so first ensure that you are using a compatible app and the stylus is paired with it. Check for the blue light to verify that it’s paired. For a list of supporting apps, pairing videos and other information visit www.wacom.com/finelinego.
 
 If you still experience this gap or offset, go to the “Stylus” settings in a compatible app and choose a hand position that fits best. Apps such as Bamboo™ Paper, Noteshelfand Notes Plus support multiple hand positions.



 If you are using non-supporting apps, you can minimize this effect by holding the stylus in a more vertical manner or by using your iPad in landscape mode.
