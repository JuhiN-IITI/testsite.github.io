# My Bamboo Fineline (3rd gen), Bamboo Fineline 2, or the original Bamboo Stylus Fineline disconnected accidentally. What can I do?

If the blue LED light is off, reconnect to the app by pressing the button. If the LED light is not on and the Bamboo Fineline is not working correctly, reconnect to the app according to the instructions in the Quick Start Guide or click here.
