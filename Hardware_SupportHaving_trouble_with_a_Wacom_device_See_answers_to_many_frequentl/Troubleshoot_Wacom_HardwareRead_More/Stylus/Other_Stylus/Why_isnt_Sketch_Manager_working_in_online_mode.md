# Why isn’t Sketch Manager working in online mode?

Online mode should work when you start Sketch Manager, open any sketch and begin writing on paper at about 10 cm distance from the receiver. Please be aware that Inkling online mode is not a tablet replacement; pressure and tilt are only recorded in your sketches, and recognition won’t work and strokes aren’t recorded in online mode. Its function is as simple as described in the product manual: to click and navigate your computer. Additionally, a computer connection can only be used to transfer your sketches to the device, and can’t be used to sketch and transfer data directly to the computer at the same time.
