# Why doesn’t my Bamboo Stylus feel work on the Samsung Galaxy Note?

Your Bamboo Stylus feel may stop working if the S Pen that came packaged with your Samsung Gallery Note is simultaneously docked in its holder. To fix this, simply follow these steps: On the Galaxy Note, select “Settings,” then click on “S Pen.” Once here, you can toggle the option for "Battery Saving.” When this is turned on, the digitizer is not active unless the pen is out of the dock (if the S pen is in its holder, no active pen will work on the display). Next, slide the pen out of its holder to activate both the Bamboo Stylus feel and the S pen.Note: If “Battery Saving” is un-checked within S Pen settings, your Bamboo Stylus feel should function properly, even if the S pen is docked in its holder.
