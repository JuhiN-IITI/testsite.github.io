# Why is the LED light on my Inkling Pen continually blinking?

Please try the steps below to stop you Inkling Pen from blinking:

Reset the receiver by pressing the reset button using the end of a paperclip or other pointed object
If the light is blinking red, the battery may be low. Place the pen in the charging case, which will glow red to indicate that the case is charging.
When fully charged, the pen status should glow green
Try to connect the cable directly to the receiver, and test it on another machine, if possible, to see if it responds differently.



For additional information, please consult the Inkling User Manual. If the pen LED continues to blink after attempting the steps above, and consulting the user manual, it is likely defective, and may need to be replaced. If you believe this to be the case, please reach out to our Support Team by clicking Contact Us below.
