# Why is the Inkling only occasionally recording my strokes?

The green LED on the receiver should light when a stroke is recorded. If your strokes aren’t recording, we suggest that you first try to create a new sketch. Then, hold the pen vertically at the upper end, and make a circle in the middle of the paper, while keeping an eye on the green LED in the middle of the receiver unit.


The light should appear and stay green while the pen tip is being used to draw on paper using normal pressure. You should then use the Sketch Manager software to see if your strokes are recording properly.


Keep in mind that the receiver needs a direct line of sight to the pen, and digital recording won’t occur if your fingertips or hand are causing a block. Please ensure that you’re correctly holding the pen; you can also change the placement of where you’re attaching the receiver to the paper.


If your strokes still aren’t recording, or if the green light flickers while drawing, there is likely a hardware problem with the data transmission from the pen to the receiver, and you will need to exchange your Inkling. If this is the case, please click Contact Us below.
