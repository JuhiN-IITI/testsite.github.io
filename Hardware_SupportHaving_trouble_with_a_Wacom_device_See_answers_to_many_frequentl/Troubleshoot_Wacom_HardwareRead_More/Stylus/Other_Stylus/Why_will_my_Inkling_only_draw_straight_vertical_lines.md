# Why will my Inkling only draw straight vertical lines?

Inkling allows you to create drawings of all kinds; if you’re only able to draw straight vertical lines, it’s possible that one of the two sensors within the receivers is broken. If you believe your Inkling is damaged, please contact the dealer where it was purchased for an exchange.
