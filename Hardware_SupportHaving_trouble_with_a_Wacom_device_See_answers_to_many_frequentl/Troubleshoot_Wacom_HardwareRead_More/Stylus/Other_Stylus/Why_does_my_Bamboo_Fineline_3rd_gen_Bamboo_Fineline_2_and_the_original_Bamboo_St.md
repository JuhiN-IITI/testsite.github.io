# Why does my Bamboo Fineline (3rd gen), Bamboo Fineline 2, and the original Bamboo Stylus Fineline stop working when I reconnect to an app?

Depending on the apps youâ€™re using, the Bamboo Fineline may disconnect when you leave the app. If the LED light is off, pair your stylus by pressing the button each time you connect to an app.
