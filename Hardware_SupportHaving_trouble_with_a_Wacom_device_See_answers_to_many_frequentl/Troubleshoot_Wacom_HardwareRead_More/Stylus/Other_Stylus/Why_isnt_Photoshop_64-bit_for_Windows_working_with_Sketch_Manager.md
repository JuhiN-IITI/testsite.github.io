# Why isn’t Photoshop 64-bit for Windows working with Sketch Manager?

If you omitted the 32-bit executable of Photoshop during installation of the 64-bit, it’s possible that scripting may have also been omitted or truncated. You simply need to install the 32-bit executable of Photoshop in addition to the 64-bit to fix this issue. For more information and guidance, please visit the Adobe Support forum.
