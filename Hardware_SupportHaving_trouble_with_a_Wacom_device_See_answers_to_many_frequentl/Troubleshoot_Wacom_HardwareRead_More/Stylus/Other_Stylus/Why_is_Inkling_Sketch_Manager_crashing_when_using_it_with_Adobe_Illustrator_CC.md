# Why is Inkling Sketch Manager crashing when using it with Adobe Illustrator CC?

If Adobe Illustrator isn't working properly with Sketch Manager, please ensure that youâ€™re using the latest version of Sketch Manager. The most current version has been thoroughly tested on OS X 10.6 through 10.9, and Windows 7. It also works well with Windows 8/Windows 8.1, although a specific version with Windows 8/8.1 compatibility is still under development, and you may experience a few minor issues. The update is available for all registered Wacom users after login, and can be found here.
