# My app screen moves when I rest my palm on the screen. How can I avoid this?

Go to “Settings/” app on your iPad or iPhone and disable “Multitasking Gestures.” However, some apps, especially drawing apps, are multi-touch enabled so they don’t support palm rejection. To prevent your app screen from moving or accidental marks you will want to avoid touching the screen with your hand.
