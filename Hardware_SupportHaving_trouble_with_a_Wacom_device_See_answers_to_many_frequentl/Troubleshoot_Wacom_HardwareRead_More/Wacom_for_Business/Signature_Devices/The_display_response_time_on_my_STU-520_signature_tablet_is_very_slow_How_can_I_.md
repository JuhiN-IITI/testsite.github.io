# The display response time on my STU-520 signature tablet is very slow. How can I improve it?

The STU-520 Tablet requires a driver for Bulk Transfer, which will greatly speed up response time. You can access the driver on our download page. Please note that other STU-series signature tablets do not require a driver.
