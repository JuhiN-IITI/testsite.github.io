# Does an electronic signature satisfy legal requirements?

In most European countries, as well as in North America, electronic signatures can generally be considered legal for the effective conclusion of all day-to-day-business contracts. With the exception of a few singular cases, most legal systems provide freedom of form for these contracts. Therefore, the effectiveness of those contracts does not depend on formal requirements, but compared to contracts that have been concluded orally or per email, contracts with our signature solution offer a significantly higher range of security. One reason for this is the possibility to identify the contractâ€™s parties by their electronic signature.
