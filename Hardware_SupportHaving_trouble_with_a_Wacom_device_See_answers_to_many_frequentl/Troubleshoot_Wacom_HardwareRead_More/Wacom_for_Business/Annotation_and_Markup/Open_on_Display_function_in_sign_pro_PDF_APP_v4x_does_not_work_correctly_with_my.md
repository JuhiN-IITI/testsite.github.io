# Open on Display function in sign pro PDF APP (v4.x) does not work correctly with my Wacom for Business 10" device (DTU-1031, DTU-1031X, DTU-1031AX).

We have identified an incompatibility with the DTU-1031AX and the Open on Display function in our sign pro PDF application (v4.x).


 


Symptom: It doesn’t size the window opened on the display correctly due to the smaller resolution.


 


Resolution: This specific feature does not work with the DTU-1031AX due to its smaller resolution. We would recommend using a compatible Wacom for Business device with higher resolution or explore other options with the Wacom for Business group.
