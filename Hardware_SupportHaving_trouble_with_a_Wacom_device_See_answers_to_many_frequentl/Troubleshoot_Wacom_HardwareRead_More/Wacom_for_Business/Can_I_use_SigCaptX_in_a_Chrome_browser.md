# Can I use SigCaptX in a Chrome browser?

Yes, you can use SigCaptX with Chrome, Firefox and Edge browsers.


For best performance, we recommend using the latest version (1.25.3 or later) of the Wacom Ink SDK for Signature, which includes SigCaptX.


If you are using an earlier version, you may experience issues in Chrome browsers due to recently released updates to Chromeâ€™s pre-flight security features. The Chrome update (v102+) will be required for all users as of August 2022.


Version 1.25.3 of the Wacom Ink SDK for Signature has been updated to utilize web sockets (where available) and improves the ability of SigCaptX to handle preflight requests like those included in the Chrome update.
