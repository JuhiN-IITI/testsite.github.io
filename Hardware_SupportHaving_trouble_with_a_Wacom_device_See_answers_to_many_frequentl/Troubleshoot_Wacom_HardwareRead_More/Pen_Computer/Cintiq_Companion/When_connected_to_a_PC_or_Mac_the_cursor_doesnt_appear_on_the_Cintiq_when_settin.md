# When connected to a PC or Mac, the cursor doesnâ€™t appear on the Cintiq when setting up the Cintiq Companion as an extended display. What do I do?

Go to the Control Panel on your PC or Preferences on your Mac. Select Display and change the Cintiq Companion to the primary display and the cursor will appear on the Cintiq. The Cintiq Companion has to be the primary display.
