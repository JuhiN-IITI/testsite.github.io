# Why don’t the pen calibration targets appear on my screen while trying to calibrate my Cintiq Companion Hybrid?

If Windows 7 is set to use larger fonts (150%), pen calibration targets won’t appear on the screen. This is because larger fonts change the size ofevery item on the display – not just text size. You can easily fix this by following these two steps: Go to the Control Panel on your PC and select “Display” In “Display,” change the font size to “Medium” (125%) or “Small” (100%)Once a smaller font size is selected, you’ll be able to calibrate your pen.
