# Why is the Setup Wizard getting stuck when I try to connect to the desktop?

If the Setup Wizard on your Cintiq Companion Hybrid is stuck at the “Connect to PC” or “Connect to Mac” step, your computer likely isn’t recognizing the device. You simply need to check the small box on the right hand side of the screen, just above the connection diagram, and next to the line that states either, “Turn on your PC” or “Turn on your Mac” to enable connectivity on your Cintiq Companion Hybrid.
