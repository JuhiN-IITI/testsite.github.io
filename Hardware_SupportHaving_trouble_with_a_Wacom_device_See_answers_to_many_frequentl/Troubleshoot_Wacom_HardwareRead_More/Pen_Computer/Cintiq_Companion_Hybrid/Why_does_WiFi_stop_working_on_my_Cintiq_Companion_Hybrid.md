# Why does WiFi stop working on my Cintiq Companion Hybrid?

When the Cintiq Companion Hybrid internal storage is full, the wireless connection will appear grayed-out, indicating that it’s unavailable. To restart WiFi, you’ll need to clear some space within the internal storage.Please note that this is only occurs on Android operating systems, and other Android tablets.
