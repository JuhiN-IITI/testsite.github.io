# If I insert a USB stick or Micro SD card into my Cintiq Companion Hybrid while in desktop mode, why doesnâ€™t it show up in Windows?

Windows only scans data storage on the Cintiq Companion Hybrid when the Cintiq is first attached to the host computer by the 3-in-1 cable. If you inserted a USB stick or Micro SD card after the initial connection, Windows will not see it. To fix this, simply unplug the 3-in-1 cable, then reattach it, and your data should be visible.
