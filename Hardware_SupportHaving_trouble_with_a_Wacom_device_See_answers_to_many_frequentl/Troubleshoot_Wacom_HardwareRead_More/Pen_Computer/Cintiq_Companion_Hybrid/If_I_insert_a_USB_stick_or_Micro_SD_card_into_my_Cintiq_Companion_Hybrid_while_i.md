# If I insert a USB stick or Micro SD card into my Cintiq Companion Hybrid while in desktop mode, why doesn’t it show up in Windows?

Windows only scans data storage on the Cintiq Companion Hybrid when the Cintiq is first attached to the host computer by the 3-in-1 cable. If you inserted a USB stick or Micro SD card after the initial connection, Windows will not see it. To fix this, simply unplug the 3-in-1 cable, then reattach it, and your data should be visible.
