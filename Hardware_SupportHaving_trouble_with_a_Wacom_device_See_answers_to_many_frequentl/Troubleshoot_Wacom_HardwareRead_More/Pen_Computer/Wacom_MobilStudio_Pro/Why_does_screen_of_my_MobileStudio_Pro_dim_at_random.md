# Why does screen of my MobileStudio Pro dim at random?

The MobileStudio Pro is equipped with an ambient light sensor. If the ambient light in your location changes, the screen brightness will adjust to compensate. Sometimes your hand moving across the sensor will cause a momentary change. If you would prefer to turn off the ambient light sensor you can do so as follows:

Swipe from the right side of the screen to open the “Charms” menu
Select “All Settings”
Select “Display”
Uncheck “Change brightness automatically when lighting changes”
