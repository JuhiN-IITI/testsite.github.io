# Will the warranty be voided if I change the SSD and / or RAM of my MobileStudio Pro?

Once the backdoor is opened, Wacom will not consider any issues on the hardware located under that section under warranty. This includes: SSD, RAM, connectors, slots, wires, circuits, electronic components, plastic covers, screws, holes, cover plates, etc.


If you add custom parts to the device, Wacom will not cover any defect on the custom parts under warranty. Our warranty only covers the original parts that came with the device, if the backdoor is not opened and the SDD and the RAM is untouched. If the custom parts malfunction, please contact the manufacturer.
