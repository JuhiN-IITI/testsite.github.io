# Why does my MobileStudio Pro 2016 only charge to 75% battery?

Wacom has updated the BIOS of the MobileStudio Pro 2016 via a Windows update to help make the most of your device’s battery health. With the update installed, the MobileStudio Pro 2016 will automatically lower the maximum charge level of the tablet to 75% if the tablet has been plugged into a power source and maintained a charge of greater than 90% for charge for more than 14 days. 



What does this mean for your tablet?


After 14 consecutive days of the MobileStudio Pro 2016 being plugged into the power source and charged to 90% or greater, the unit will drain down to 70% power to maximize battery health. The tablet will then maintain a charge level between 70% and 75% power. If the device is unplugged from the power source, allowed to discharge below 70% and then connected again, the unit will charge to maximum capacity and start the 14-day timeframe again.


Note: While the unit is draining down to 70% power, you may receive the message “Plugged in, not charging.”


If your tablet continues not to charge after it has reached 69% or if your tablet is not one of the models listed below, please contact Support, using the contact button below.


This update is available for the following models: DTHW1620H, DTHW1620M, DTHW1320H, DTHW1320M, DTHW1320L, DTHW1320T
