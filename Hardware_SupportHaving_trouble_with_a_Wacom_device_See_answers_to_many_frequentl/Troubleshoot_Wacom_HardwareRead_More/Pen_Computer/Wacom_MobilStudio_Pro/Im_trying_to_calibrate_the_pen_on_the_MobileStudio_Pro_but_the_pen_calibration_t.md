# I’m trying to calibrate the pen on the MobileStudio Pro, but the pen calibration targets don’t appear on the screen. How do I calibrate it?

If Windows 8.1 is set to use larger fonts (150%), pen calibration targets won’t appear on the screen. To change this: 

Go to the Control Panel on your PC and select Display 
Change the font size to Medium – 125% or Small – 100%.
Selecting larger fonts changes the size of every item on the display, not only text.
