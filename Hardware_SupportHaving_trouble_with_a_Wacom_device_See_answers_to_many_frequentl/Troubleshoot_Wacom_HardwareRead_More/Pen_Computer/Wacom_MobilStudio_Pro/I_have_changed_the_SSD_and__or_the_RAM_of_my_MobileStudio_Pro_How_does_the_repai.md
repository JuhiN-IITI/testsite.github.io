# I have changed the SSD and / or the RAM of my MobileStudio Pro. How does the repair work?

In case you upgrade or replace the SSD and / or the RAM and the device needs to be repaired, there are 2 possible scenarios:

The device is sent with its original parts – In this case we will repair the device normally and return it once the repair is done.
The device is sent with custom parts – In this case, the custom parts are uninstalled. Parts analog to the original parts are installed. We then repair and restore the device to its original condition. Once this is done, the analog parts are remove and the device is returned to the customer. The custom parts will be package in a separate contained and returned with the same shipping.
