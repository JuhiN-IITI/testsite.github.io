# "Something went wrong (code: 0x8009002d") when trying to login after the MobileStudio Pro BIOS update.

Due to the recent identified security breach related to Intel chip, which puts our MobileStudio Pro at risk, Wacom has worked with Intel and our manufacturing partner to develop a BIOS update for this issue.
 This update however removes any stored Fingerprint/Pin set up for login. Which can give the above error code when trying to log in.
 To fix this issue, simply login using the password set up for this user.
 You will then be able to setup a fingerprint/pin for login again under the user settings.
 If you have any questions or encounter any issue, please contact Wacom support using the contact button below.
 For more details and technical info about the security breach visit Intel´s website here.
