# When connected to a PC or Mac, the cursor doesn’t appear on the Cintiq when setting up the MobileStudio Pro as an extended display. What do I do?

Go to the Control Panel on your PC or Preferences on your Mac. Select Display and change the MobileStudio Pro to the primary display and the cursor will appear on the Cintiq. The MobileStudio Pro has to be the primary display.
