# When running Adobe Photoshop on a QHD or UHD display, the menus and text seem very small.

This could be due to a couple reasons. 1. Update to the latest version of Adobe CC. If using a 2015 version of Photoshop CC, the 66 and 32 bit versions can act differently. Please make sure that the updated version is installed, or run the 32 bit version of the software. Please see www.adobe.com for details 2. Some software applications do not take full advantage of QHD and UHD resolutions within their respective UI (user interface). You can make sure that Photoshop is running with UI Scaling enabled (under Edit >Preferences)
