# When using the hybrid mode with desktop PC performance can I transfer my files from desktop to my MobileStudio Pro to continue my work on the go?

Yes, you just need to keep a SD card inserted in your MobileStudio Pro. This data storage can be seen and accessed by your desktop to transfer your files to your MobileStudio Pro.
