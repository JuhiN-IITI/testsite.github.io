# The Wacom Stand MobileStudio Pro does not fit my Wacom MobileStudio Pro. What can I do?

You many need to replace your clips on your MobileStudio Pro. Please use the clip kit provided in your packaging, under the Quick Start Guide, which includes:

4 Clips
4 Screws
1 Torx Screw Driver
1 Instruction card



Also, please view this Clip Replacement Tutorial Video or follow these step-by-step instructions to replace your clips:

Carefully remove clips, small screws and screw driver from the package.
Using the screw driver, loosen all 4 screws on the back of the device.
Carefully push on the end of the clip furthest from the screw opening to lift the clip off the back of the device.
Insert all 4 new clips first to ensure you do not drop the screws into the device.
Insert new screws and tighten until you feel some resistance.
Attach Wacom Stand to Device.



CAUTION: DO NOT overtighten as this may strip the screw and damage your device!
