# Why does my pen computer not turn on?

Pen computers like the Wacom MobileStudio Pro or Cintiq Companion, are battery powered and charged using a power adapter.


Plug the charger to the tablet and make sure the chargerâ€™s power plug is connected directly to an active wall outlet. With most tablets the power cable from the wall outlet can be removed from the power adapter. Make sure the connection between the two is secure. Once connected a charging light will appear on the tablet. Once charging is complete the power light will turn green.


If the unit still receives no power or does not turn on once charged, contact Wacom support. Please have a copy of the sales receipt for the tablet available as it will be needed to validate the warranty.
