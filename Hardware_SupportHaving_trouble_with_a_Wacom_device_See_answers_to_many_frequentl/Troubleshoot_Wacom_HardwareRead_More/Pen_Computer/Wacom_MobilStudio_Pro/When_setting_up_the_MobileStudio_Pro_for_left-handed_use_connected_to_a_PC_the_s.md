# When setting up the MobileStudio Pro for left-handed use connected to a PC, the screen appears upside down when first starting up my computer. Why does this occur?

Although the screen first appears upside down, it corrects itself by the time the Windows log- in page appears. Windows retains your settings and you do not need to reset the orientation. This is a Windows feature.
