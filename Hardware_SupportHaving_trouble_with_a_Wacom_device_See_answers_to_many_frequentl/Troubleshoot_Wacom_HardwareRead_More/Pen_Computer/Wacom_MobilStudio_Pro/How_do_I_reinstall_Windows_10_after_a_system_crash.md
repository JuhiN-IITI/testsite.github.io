# How do I reinstall Windows 10 after a system crash?

In the rare event that the MobileStudio Pro crashes, you can reinstall Windows 10 by following the steps below:

Select “Settings”
Select “Change PC settings” 
Select whether you want to refresh or reset your MobileStudio Pro 
And, if you want to boot into the recovery partition while booting up, please press “F9” (note: update to the latest BIOS to MobileStudio Pro first) once you power on the system 
Then you can see “Trouble shooting” option under system restoration.
