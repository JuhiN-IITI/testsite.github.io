# Does Wacom Canvas automatically save my drawings?

Yes. If the image is not saved while drawing, it will be saved automatically when the application is closed or transitions to the background.
The file will be saved with this naming convention "~~~~~auto .png".
Until a new app is launched or a new canvas is created, the auto save will overwrite the same file.
