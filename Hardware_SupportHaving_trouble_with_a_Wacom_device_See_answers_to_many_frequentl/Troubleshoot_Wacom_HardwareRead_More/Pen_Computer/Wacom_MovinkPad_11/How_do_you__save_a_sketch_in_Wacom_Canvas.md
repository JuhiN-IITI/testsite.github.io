# How do you  save a sketch in Wacom Canvas?

When you create a new canvas or close Wacom Canvas, your sketches are automatically saved. You can review them later as creative ideas from the Wacom Shelf app. Even if you export a sketch from the share menu, you can continue adding to it while keeping the canvas open.
If you add more to the sketch and then close Wacom Canvas or export it again, it will be saved as a separate file.
