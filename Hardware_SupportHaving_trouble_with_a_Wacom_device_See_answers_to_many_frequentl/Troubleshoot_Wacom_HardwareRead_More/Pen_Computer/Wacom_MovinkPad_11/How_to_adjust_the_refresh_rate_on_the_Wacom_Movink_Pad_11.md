# How to adjust the refresh rate on the Wacom Movink Pad 11.

By adjusting the refresh rate, you can maximize the performance of drawing apps or save battery life.
By default, refresh rate is set to Adaptive.
You can check and change this setting in the Settings app under Display > Refresh rate.

[Standard (60 Hz)]
Updates the screen 60 times per second. Recommended for those who want to extend battery life.

[High (90 Hz)]
Updates the screen 90 times per second. This setting consumes more battery but is recommended for those who want to run all apps more smoothly.
