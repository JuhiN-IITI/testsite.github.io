# How do you start drawing right from sleep mode with the Wacom MovinkPad 11?

Simply press the Pro Pen 3 to the screen while in sleep mode. MovinkPad 11 will respond to the pen and launch Wacom Canvas.
This method can be enabled or disabled, and it is enabled by default.
You can check this setting in the Settings app under Display > Quick drawing.

You can also press and hold the "Shortcut button" on the lock screen to launch Wacom Canvas. The shortcut button can be repositioned or turned off, and by default, it is set to the left side of the lock screen. You can check this setting in the Settings app under Display > Lock screen > Shortcuts.

Finally you can Press the "Power button" on MovinkPad twice in quick succession to launch Wacom Canvas, even from sleep mode. This method can be enabled or disabled, and it is enabled by default. You can check this setting in the Settings app under System > Gestures.
