# Using Touch Gestures on the Wacom MovinkPad 11.

By using touch gestures on the canvas, you can perform various functions without needing to press any buttons.
Example on Wacom Canvas (v1.3.1 and later)
Tapping the canvas or background with two fingers will undo the last action. You can undo up to 20 actions.
Tapping the canvas or background with three fingers will redo the last undone action. You can redo up to 20 actions.
Dragging with two fingers on the canvas or background allows you to move the canvas.
When the canvas is zoomed in or out, double-tapping with one finger on the canvas or background will reset the canvas to its original display size.
