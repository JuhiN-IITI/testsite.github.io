# Can I write all the way to the edges and corners of the paper on Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, and Bamboo Spark?

Yes, as long as all writing is captured within the active area of the Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, and Bamboo Spark you can write to the edges and corners of the paper. The active area is defined as the area inside the rectangular stitches on the smartpad where you insert the notepad.
