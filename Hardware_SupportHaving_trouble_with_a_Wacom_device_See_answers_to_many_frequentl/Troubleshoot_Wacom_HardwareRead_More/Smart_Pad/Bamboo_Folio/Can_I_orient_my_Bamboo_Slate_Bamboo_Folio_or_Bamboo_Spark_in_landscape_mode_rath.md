# Can I orient my Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, or Bamboo Spark in landscape mode rather than portrait?

Yes, you can adjust page orientation in the Inkspace app settings. Go to the general settings and look for “Device Orientation,” where you change the page orientation of your Bamboo Slate, Bamboo Folio, or Bamboo Spark by 90 degrees.
