# I used to have Ink-to-Text with my Bamboo Spark, now it's gone?

Please sign out of the Inkspace App and sign back in using your Wacom ID.
You may also need to re-Pair your Bamboo Spark.
Go to Settings and re-run the pairing process (even if you are already paired).
You should see the Ink-to-text feature now.
