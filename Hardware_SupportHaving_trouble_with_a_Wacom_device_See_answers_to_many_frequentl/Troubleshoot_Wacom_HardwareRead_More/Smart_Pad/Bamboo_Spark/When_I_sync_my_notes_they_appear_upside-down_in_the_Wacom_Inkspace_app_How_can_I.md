# When I sync my notes, they appear upside-down in the Wacom Inkspace app. How can I change the orientation in the app for left-handed use?

In the Wacom Inkspace app, you can flip the orientation of the device for left-handed use by going to the Inkspace app settings and selecting ‘device orientation.’ To adjust the orientation, place your finger on the orange dot and turn the image of the device so the notepad is on the left side. You can now use the notepad on the Bamboo Slate or Bamboo Folio on the left side.
