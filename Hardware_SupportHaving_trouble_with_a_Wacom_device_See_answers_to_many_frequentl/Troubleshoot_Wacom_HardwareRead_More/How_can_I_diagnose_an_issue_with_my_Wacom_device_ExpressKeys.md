# How can I diagnose an issue with my Wacom device ExpressKeys?

Before you begin check the following: 

Make sure the latest version of the Wacom Driver for your device is installed. See our Product Resources page: https://www.wacom.com/download  
The steps below are focused on ExpressKey troubleshooting. To diagnose other hardware issues, see the related articles:

If the ExpressKeys™ do not work as expected, check the assigned functions or reset them to their default conditions. 

Open Wacom Tablet Properties and click on the About button. In the dialog that appears, click Diagnose... The Diagnostics dialog shows dynamic information about the tablet, your tool(s), and appropriate information for touch-sensitive tablets.
If more than one pen tablet is connected to your system, select the one you are testing in the Device Info column.
With the Diagnostics dialog open, observe the Device Info column as you test each ExpressKey. Be sure you have selected the tablet you are testing from the Device Info column.


Test the keys by pressing them one at a time. Each time you press a key, its number is shown next to the Left Buttons category.
When you are done, click the Close button.



If this test fails, please contact Customer Support.
