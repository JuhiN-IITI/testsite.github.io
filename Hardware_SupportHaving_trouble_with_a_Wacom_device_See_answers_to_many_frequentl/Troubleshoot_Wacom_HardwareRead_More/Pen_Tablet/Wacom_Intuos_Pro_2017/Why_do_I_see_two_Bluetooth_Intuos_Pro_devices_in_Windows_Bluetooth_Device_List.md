# Why do I see two Bluetooth Intuos Pro devices in Windows Bluetooth Device List?

Intuos Pro M and L support two Bluetooth technologies: Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth 4.2 Low Energy. Choose the Bluetooth Classic name "BT IntuosPro M or "BT IntuosPro L when pairing with computers. Choose "IntuosPro S" when pairing a Wacom Intuos Pro S with computers.
