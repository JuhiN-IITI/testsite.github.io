# Why does it take so long to connect to my mobile device?

When Wacom Intuos Pro starts up in wireless mode, it first attempts to connect to the most recently connected computer and then to the second computer. When it cannot connect to either, then it connects to you your mobile device. Once it has connected, it will send all data immediately to your mobile device without delay.
