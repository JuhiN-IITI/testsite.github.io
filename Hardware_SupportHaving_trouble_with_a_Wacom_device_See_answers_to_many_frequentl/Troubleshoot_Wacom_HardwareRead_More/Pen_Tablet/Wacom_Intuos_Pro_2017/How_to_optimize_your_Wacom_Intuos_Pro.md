# How to optimize your Wacom Intuos Pro.

The Wacom Intuos Pro uses a Bluetooth connection to pair with a computer. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances. Bluetooth and USB connections each have individual pros, cons and the best choice depends on your individual needs. Bluetooth by nature is slower than a USB connection and a user may see lag and/or connections issues depending on interference, connection type and environmental factors.


Wacom offers the following suggestions to help optimize the tablet’s performance when using a Bluetooth connection.

Ensure you are using a compatible Bluetooth version. The Wacom Intuos Pro needs at least a Bluetooth 2.1 connection. For a better performance we recommend Bluetooth 4.0. For best performance we recommend Bluetooth 4.2.
Use only the current driver and firmware updated through the Wacom Desktop Center. If you do not have a driver installed, download and install the latest driver from the Wacom driver page.  
Update the computer’s operating system, making sure all current Windows and Apple OS updates are installed.
It is recommend to disable the touch function in Bluetooth mode in order to reduce the data transfer between tablet and computer. Do so by setting the touch on/off slider on the side of the tablet to off.
If able, remove all pairings with all Bluetooth devices from the computer. Pair Wacom Intuos Pro again and use exclusively for best performance. The more devices connected the more data that is used in the Bluetooth connection, which will slow down performance.
With Apple OS, you can check your Bluetooth signal Strength. The Resource Strength Signal Indicator (RSSI) should be between 0 and -50. The higher the value the better performance. This is shown in the Bluetooth setting for the computer. 
  
Hold the Option key while clicking the Bluetooth menu to get additional information and settings for Bluetooth devices.
With the optional Bluetooth menu activated, select your listed Bluetooth device and the submenu for it should show the detected RSSI value for it.
 



 Minimize sources of interference. A good article explaining different types of interference and how to minimize them can be found here.
