# Why isn’t the side switch on my pen working?

You can check the functionality of your pen’s side switch through the following series of tests:

Press the side switch, without pressing down on the pen tip, when the pen tip is within proximity of the tablet (optimal distance is 5mm).
Check your tablet’s driver settings: From the Wacom Tablet Control Panel, verify that the side switch is set to the function you expect the application and input tool to execute.
Verify that the side switch mode is set to “Click & Tap.” You’ll find this setting on the Wacom Tablet Control Panel,” under “Options.”
The diagnostics panel is also a valuable resource for testing the side switch. Access it by clicking the "About" button within the Wacom Tablet Properties, then click "Diagnose."




 "X Data" and "Y Data" will change as you move the pen around over the tablet.
 "Switches" will change to reflect the pen making contact with the tablet, or when either side switch button is pressed (as long as the pen is within range).



 If you feel that there is a hardware problem with the pen, please contact Wacom Customer Support.
