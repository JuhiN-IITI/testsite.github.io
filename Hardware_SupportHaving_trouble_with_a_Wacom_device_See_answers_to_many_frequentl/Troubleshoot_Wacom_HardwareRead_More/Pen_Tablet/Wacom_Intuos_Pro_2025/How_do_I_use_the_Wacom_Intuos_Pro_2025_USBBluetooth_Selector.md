# How do I use the Wacom Intuos Pro (2025) USB/Bluetooth Selector?

The USB/Bluetooth selector switch allows you to connect and switch between up to three computers:

USB Connection: When the selector switch is in the USB position (far right), the tablet connects to the computer via the USB cable.
Bluetooth Connection: When the selector is in the middle (BT1) or far left (BT2) positions, it connects to devices paired via Bluetooth. This allows you to switch between two different computers wirelessly.
Important Notes:
You'll need to install the Wacom driver and configure settings on each computer you want to use with the tablet.
Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on the computers to connect wirelessly.
