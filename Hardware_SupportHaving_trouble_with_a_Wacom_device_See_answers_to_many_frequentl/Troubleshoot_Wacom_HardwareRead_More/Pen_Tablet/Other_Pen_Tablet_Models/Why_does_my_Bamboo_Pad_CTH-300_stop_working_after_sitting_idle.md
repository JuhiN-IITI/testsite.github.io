# Why does my Bamboo Pad CTH-300 stop working after sitting idle?

In order to save battery life, your Bamboo Pad automatically goes into sleep mode after sitting idle for a while, and you simply need to tap the front mouse button to begin using it again. If it doesn't immediately "wake up," tap the mouse two or three times more times, or tap your pen to the screen.
