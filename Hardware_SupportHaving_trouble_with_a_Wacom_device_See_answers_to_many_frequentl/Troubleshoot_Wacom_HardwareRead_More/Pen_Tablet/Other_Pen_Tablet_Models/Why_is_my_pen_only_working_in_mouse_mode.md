# Why is my pen only working in mouse mode?

If your pen is only functioning in mouse mode, it’s likely that the tablet driver software wasn’t installed or didn’t load properly. To fix this, first ensure that the tablet driver software is installed and functioning. If not, install the pen tablet driver software in accordance with the instructions found in the installation section of your product manual.
