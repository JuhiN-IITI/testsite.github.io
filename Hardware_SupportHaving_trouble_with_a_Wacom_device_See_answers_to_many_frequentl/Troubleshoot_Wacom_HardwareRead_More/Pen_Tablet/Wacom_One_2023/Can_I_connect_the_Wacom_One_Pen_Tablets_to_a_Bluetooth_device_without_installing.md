# Can I connect the Wacom One Pen Tablets to a Bluetooth device without installing the Wacom driver?

Yes, when pairing look for ""Wacom One S"" and ""Wacom One M"" in the Bluetooth settings of your operating system and select the device.


Note: When the Wacom One pen tablet (CTC6110WL, CTC4110WL) is connected via Bluetooth and if the pen is not operated for 15 minutes or more, the device will go into sleep mode to save the battery power.


To use the Wacom One again, press and hold the power button on the left side of the pen tablet and check the blue LED is ON.


As soon as the blue light turns on, remove your finger from the button and check the Wacom One is working properly.
