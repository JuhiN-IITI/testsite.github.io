# How to see the battery status on the Wacom One Pen Tablets?

The battery Status is only viewed within the Wacom tablet driver (Wacom Center) when installed. If you have not installed the Wacom tablet driver, please connect the Bluetooth and refer to the Bluetooth Settings screen after confirming that the pen is working. You will not be able to check the battery level if it is not paired in real time."
