# What is the "mode switch" button on the Wacom One Pen Tablets

This button is not normally used in your day to day operation. It can be used to manually switch the OS version you are working on if the tablet does not switch properly.
If needed press this button when you change the connection environment from/to Android Windows or macOS and it does not work automatically.
