# Is the Wacom One Pen Tablets compatible with Windows 7 and 8.1?

The Wacom driver no longer supports these older operating system and does not support that setup. However, the tablet can be used with Windows 7/8.1 without the tablet driver, but please note that there will be some limitations, such as the inability to change the side switch settings, etc.
