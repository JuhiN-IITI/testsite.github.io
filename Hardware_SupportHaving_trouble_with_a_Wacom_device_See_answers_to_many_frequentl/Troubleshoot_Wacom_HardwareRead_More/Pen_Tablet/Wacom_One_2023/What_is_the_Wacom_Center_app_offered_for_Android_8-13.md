# What is the Wacom Center app offered for Android 8-13?

The main purpose of this application is to adjust the coordinate range on the Wacom One Pen Tablets to support distortion-free pen input on your Android device. It is exclusively for use with the Wacom One Pen Tablets (CTC4110WL & CTC6110WL) on Android 8-13 devices. If you are using one of those pen tablets with an Android 8-13 device, please download the app from the Google Play or another Android App Store.

Update June 2024


Recent Updates to Android 14 from Google fixed the pen tablet mapping that the Wacom Center app corrected.


1. Android 14 & later always provides distortion free pen tablet input.


2. Android 14 & later supports pen tablet input for all Android device orientations.


Therefore the Wacom Center app is not required on Android 14 & later. If you installed Wacom Center on Android 14 & later, please uninstall it again.


To connect your Wacom One Pen Tablet via Bluetooth on Android 14 & later, pair it in the Android System Settings.
