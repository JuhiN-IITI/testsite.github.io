# What is the Wacom Center app offered for Android 8-13?

The main purpose of this application is to adjust the coordinate range on the Wacom One Pen Tablets to support distortion-free pen input on your Android device. It is exclusively for use with the Wacom One Pen Tablets (CTC4110WL & CTC6110WL) on Android 8-13 devices. If you are using one of those pen tablets with an Android 8-13 device, please download the app from the Google Play or another Android App Store.


Â 


Update June 2024


Recent Updates to Android 14 from Google fixed the pen tablet mapping that the Wacom Center app corrected.


1. Android 14 & later always provides distortion free pen tablet input.


2. Android 14 & later supports pen tablet input for all Android device orientations.


Therefore the Wacom Center app is not required on Android 14 & later. If you installed Wacom Center on Android 14 & later, please uninstall it again.


To connect your Wacom One Pen Tablet via Bluetooth on Android 14 & later, pair it in the Android System Settings.
