# Why is there no power on my One by Wacom(CTL-472, CTL-672)?

The tablet is connected to a computer over a USB cable and will show a power light on the tablet once connected. Â 


If there is no power light on the tablet, make sure the tablet is connected directly to the computer, avoid using USB hubs, keyboard/monitor ports, or docking stations with the tablets, as they can cause inconsistent behavior. If the tablet has a wireless kit, remove the kit completely from the tablet and test again. If the tablet still does not receive power on, test with a new USB cable if able.


If the issue continues, contact Wacom support. Please have a copy of the sales receipt for the tablet available as it will be needed to validate the warranty for repair.
