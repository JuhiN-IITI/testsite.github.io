# Why is my pen pressure not working on my One by Wacom(CTL-472, CTL-672)?

Many applications have built-in support for pressure sensitivity that require you to turn on pressure capabilities within the application before the pen will respond as a pressure-sensitive tool. 
A loss of pressure sensitivity could also be caused by interference from another device near the tablet, or by the use of a specific software or plugin. 
Incorrect driver settings and pen defects can also cause you to lose pressure sensitivity. The following articles will help you determine if any of the above issues are causing your pressure sensitivity problem. 

Ensure that the Wacom Driver is working as expected: Pen input or touch input does not work as expected
