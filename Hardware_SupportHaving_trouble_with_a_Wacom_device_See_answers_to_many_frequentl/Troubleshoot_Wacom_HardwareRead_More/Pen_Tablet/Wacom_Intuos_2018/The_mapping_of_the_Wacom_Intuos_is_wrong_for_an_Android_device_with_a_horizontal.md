# The mapping of the Wacom Intuos is wrong for an Android device with a horizontal display.

Android 14 & later supports distortion free pen input for all Android device orientations.


Important: If the screen cursor movement is distorted compared to the pen movement on your Wacom Intuos, switch the Wacom Intuos mode manually.


Android 8-13 devices in horizontal orientation are typically not compatible with the Wacom Intuos or Wacom One pen tablets due to pen input limitations in in those versions of Android.
