# Why is my Wacom Intuos (CTL-4100WLx, CTL-6100WLx) no longer working over Bluetooth or not showing up under Bluetooth settings when in pairing mode?

The Bluetooth settings may have been become corrupt. To fix this issue, re-pair the Wacom Intuos to a computer with Bluetooth by following the steps below.

If your tablet is connected to your computer by USB, disconnect the USB cable.
Open your computer's Bluetooth menu and turn on Bluetooth
Press the power button on your tablet until the blue LED starts to blink.
If your tablet was previously connected to a computer which is now off or out of range, the blue LED above the power button will blink quickly for 15 seconds.
The blue LED slowly blinking indicates the tablet is discoverable by Bluetooth.
In your computer's Bluetooth menu, select your tablet's name when it appears.
Click Pair or complete the pairing process per your operating system's instructions.
The blue LED will stop blinking when your tablet is connected.
Close the Bluetooth menu.

After you pair your computer to your tablet, you can switch between a Bluetooth and USB connection by plugging and unplugging the USB cable.
