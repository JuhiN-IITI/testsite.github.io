# When I use Wacom Intuos with PC or Mac, the cursor changes to dot”・” or “Win” follows the cursor.

Wacom Intuos switches to Android mode when both the right and left Express keys on Wacom Intuos are pressed for 3-4 seconds even when connected to a PC or Mac. Then the cursor changes to a dot”・” or “Win” follows the cursor. Please press both of the right and left Express key for 3-4 seconds again to switch back to PC mode, or unplug and reconnect the USB cable.


LED lights brightly →PC（Windows/mac） mode


LED lights darkly →Android mode


If “Windows Key” is customized on the right end of Express key, “Win” follows the cursor even if Wacom Intuos is in PC mode, or disconnecting USB cable. Please click the right end of Express key again.
