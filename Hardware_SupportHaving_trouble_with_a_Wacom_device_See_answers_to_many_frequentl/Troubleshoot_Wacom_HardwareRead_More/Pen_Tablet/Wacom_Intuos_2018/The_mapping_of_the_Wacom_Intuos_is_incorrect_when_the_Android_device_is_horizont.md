# The mapping of the Wacom Intuos is incorrect when the Android device is horizontal.

Android 14 & later supports distortion free pen input for all Android device orientations.


Important: If the screen cursor movement is distorted compared to the pen movement on your Wacom Intuos, switch the Wacom Intuos mode manually.


When using Android 8-13, Wacom strongly recommends using the Android device in a vertical orientation due to pen input limitations in those versions of Android.
