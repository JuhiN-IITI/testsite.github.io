# Can I connect the Cintiq Pro 16 (2021) with Displayport / mini Displayport connections?

We can’t recommend perfectly but please use third party Displayport / mini Displayport (male) to HDMI (female) adapter or cable.
If you want to use with maximum 4K resolution, please purchase Displayport 1.4 or more and 4K”60Hz”.
