# Where I can find replacement nibs for my Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (2021)?

The Wacom Cintiq Pro ships with total 13 (10 on stand+3 on pen holder) spare nibs which are the same as the nib that came in your Pro Pen 2. You can find these spare nibs inside the pen holder clipped into the side of the Cintiq and inside of pen stand.
