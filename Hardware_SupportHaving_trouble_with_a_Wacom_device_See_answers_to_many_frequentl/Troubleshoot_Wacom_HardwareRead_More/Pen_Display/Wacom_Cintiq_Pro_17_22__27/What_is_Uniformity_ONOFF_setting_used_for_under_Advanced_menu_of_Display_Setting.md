# What is Uniformity ON/OFF setting used for under Advanced menu of Display Setting on the Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (2022)?

Uniformity turns on the ability for the display to adjust color and luminance in 9 zones divided in a grid across the screen. This feature is turned on automatically by choosing to add uniformity to the profiling workflow within Wacom Color Manager.
