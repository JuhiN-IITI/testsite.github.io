# Can I use my current Pro Pen on a Wacom Cintiq Pro 17, 22 or 27?

Yes, the previous generation of pens (for example those included with the Wacom Cintiq Pro 32), including the Pro Pen 2, are compatible with the Wacom Cintiq Pro and will perform as they do on previous generation products. However, the best pen experience will be achieved on the Wacom Cintiq Pro using the new Pro Pen 3 that ships with the pen display.
