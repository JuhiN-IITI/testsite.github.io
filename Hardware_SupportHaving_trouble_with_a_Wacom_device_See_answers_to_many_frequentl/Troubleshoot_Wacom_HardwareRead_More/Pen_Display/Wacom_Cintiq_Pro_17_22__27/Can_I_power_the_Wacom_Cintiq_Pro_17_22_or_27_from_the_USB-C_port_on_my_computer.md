# Can I power the Wacom Cintiq Pro 17, 22 or 27 from the USB-C port on my computer?

No, due to the power requirements of the Wacom Cintiq Pro, Wacom AC Power Adapter supplied with your Wacom Cintiq Pro is required to power the creative pen display. You can power peripherals up to 5V, 1.5A that are plugged into the Wacom Cintiq Pro.
