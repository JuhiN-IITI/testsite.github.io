# Wacom Cintiq Pro 17, 22, 27: Built-in Display Settings, how do I use the PQ Rec.2100, PQ DCI or HLG Rec.2100 Color Mode options?

To use these options, your video card and operating system need to support HDR output and HDR needs to be enabled. Please enable HDR for your video card first, then check the Cintiq Pro 27 Built-in Display Settings settings: if "Color Mode" did not automatically switch to one of the HDR Color Modes (PQ Rec.2100, PQ DCI or HLG Rec.2100), select the appropriate Color Mode manually.
