# When I try to update the firmware on my Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 from the Wacom Center the display stopped working.

If the computer signal or power to the Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 is forcibly stopped by pressing the power button or unplugging the USB or power cable during the firmware update, this may cause the tablet to no longer work correctly. In some cases, once power is restored the update progress bar will continue and an error message will appear after the progress bar reaches 100%.


If this happens please follow the steps below.

Disconnect the table from the computer and then unplug the power cable from the tablet as well.
Wait 30 seconds
Now reconnect the cables and turn on the tablet.

This should return to the FW version to the previous version installed before the update was attempted and resolve the issue.


Now open the Wacom Center and run the update again.



Note: In rare cases this may not work, and the unit will need to be sent into Wacom's repair team. If the issue continues after trying the steps above, please contact Wacom Support.
