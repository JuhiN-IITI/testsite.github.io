# Can pen nibs I have purchased for previous generations pens be used with the Pro Pen 3?

No, the Pro Pen 3 uses a new nib design and size. Nibs for previous pens are not compatible with new Pro Pen 3 included with the Wacom Cintiq Pro 27. Replacement pen nibs (Standard: ACK24801Z and Felt: ACK24819Z can be purchased from the Wacom eStore.
