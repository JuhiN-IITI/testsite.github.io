# Wacom Cintiq Pro 17, 22, 27: Built-in Display Settings messages and their meanings.

Message: Power Lost

When this option is On, the display will show a message when it is powered on again after an unexpected loss of power (e.g. power cable unplugged).


Message: USB Disconnection

When this option is On and you manually switch the Video Input Source to another PC, the display will show a message that this may also switch your USB connection.Â  This message appears to help avoid data corruption on USB storage devices that may be connected to the USB ports of the display.


USB Power Supply

When USB Power Supply is set to Off and the Cintiq Pro is turned off with the Power button, any USB devices connected to the USB ports of the Cintiq Pro will be turned off as well.
When USB Power Supply is set to On and the Cintiq Pro is turned off with the Power button, any USB devices connected to the USB ports of the Cintiq Pro will continue to receive power and stay connected to the PC. Note: This increases the power consumption when the display is turned off.


LED Luminance

This option sets the brightness of the power LED on the upper right side of the display.


Compatibility Mode

This may resolve compatibility issues with video input. Unless you have video input problems that can be solved with this, Wacom recommends to keep this setting Off at all times.


Reset

This option resets the Display setting parameters (e.g. Color Mode to Native, all Color Modes to their default values). It does not reset any Calibration Presets stored in the device with the Wacom Color Manager. It does not change any other settings available in the Built-in Display Settings.


Factory Reset

This option resets the all the parameters in the Built-in Display Settings menu to their defaults, and erases any Calibration Presets stored in the device with the Wacom Color Manager.
