# What are the accessory pens I can use with the Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (2022)?

Some previous generation accessory pens (Art Pen, Pro Pen, Pro Pen 3D, Pro Pen 2, Pro Pen 2 Slim) are compatible with the new Wacom Cintiq Pro pen display. Performance of these pens will be at the level as used on the previous generation of Cintiq pen displays.
