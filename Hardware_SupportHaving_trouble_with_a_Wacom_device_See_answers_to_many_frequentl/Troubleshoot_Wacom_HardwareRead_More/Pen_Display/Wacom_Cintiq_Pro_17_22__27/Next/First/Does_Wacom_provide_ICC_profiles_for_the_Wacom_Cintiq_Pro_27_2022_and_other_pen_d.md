# Does Wacom provide ICC profiles for the Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (2022) and other pen displays?

Wacom does not provide ICC profiles directly to our customers. For customers who require ICC profiles, there are a couple of options. Our first suggestion is to purchase a Wacom Color Manager or a device compatible with the Wacom Color Manager software. Customers can easily create ICC profiles using the Wacom Color Manager.


 


For customers who do not own a Wacom Color Manager, there are other ways to obtain ICC profiles. Depending on the color space, ICC profiles can be found on the internet. For example, the Cintiq Pro 27 is particularly accurate with regards to sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3/Display P3 coverage. Customers can choose one of these color spaces using the OSD menu and then download the corresponding ICC profile from the following locations:


 


Adobe RGB: https://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/adobergb.html


sRGB: https://www.color.org/srgbprofiles.xalter


DCI-P3: https://www.color.org/chardata/rgb/DCIP3.xalter
