These buttons are ExpressKeys that offer instant access to keyboard shortcuts and other fast actions. The ExpressKey settings can be customized from the Wacom Center. The buttons can also be used to adjust your display settings by pressing the middle button on the back of your Cintiq Pro to open the built-in display settings menu.
