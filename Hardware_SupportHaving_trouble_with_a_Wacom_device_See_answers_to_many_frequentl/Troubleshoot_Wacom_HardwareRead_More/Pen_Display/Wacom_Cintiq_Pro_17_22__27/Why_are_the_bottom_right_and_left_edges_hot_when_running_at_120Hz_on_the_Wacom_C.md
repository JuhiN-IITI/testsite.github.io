# Why are the bottom right and left edges hot when running at 120Hz on the Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (2022)?

When running at 120Hz, the Cintiq Pen 27 will run hot because the processing power of the Cintiq Pro 27 will be significantly increased.
Please try setting the graphics board of your PC to 60Hz to lower the temperature. Please note, that under this setting, the latency of the pen will be the same level as the previous generation Cintiq Pro.
