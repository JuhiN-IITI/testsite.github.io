# How do I access the On-screen Display Menu with the Wacom Cintiq 16 / 24 (2025)?

On the left side of the Wacom Cintiq 16 / 24, click the On-Screen Display (OSD) button, which is the second button from the bottom of the display. This will open the OSD Menu. To navigate the menus, on the Cintiq 24 Touch simply use your finger to touch the display and move through the navigation options. On the Cintiq 16 and Cintiq 24 Non-Touch models, press the OSD button to open the menu, and use your Pro Pen 3 to tap and select the menu options.
