# How to connect the Wacom Cintiq 16 / 24 to your computer?

The Wacom Cintiq 16 is connected either directly using the included USB-C cable (Display port Alt-Mode required) or a HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable (not included). If you are using the HDMI connection you will still need to connect the USB-C cable or a USB-C to USB-A (not included) cable to the computer for the pen and touch functions to function. Power adapter must be used if your computer does not provide 15W Power delivery. See the diagrams below for connecting the display to your computer.
