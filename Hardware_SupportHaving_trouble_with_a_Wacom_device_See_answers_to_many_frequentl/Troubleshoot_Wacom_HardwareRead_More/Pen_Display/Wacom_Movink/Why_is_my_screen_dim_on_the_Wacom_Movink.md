# Why is my screen dim on the Wacom Movink?

Like any display, sufficient power is required and when connected to a device with insufficient power from the USB-C port, the Wacom Movink display may not be bright enough or may not operate properly. For power sources less than 15W, brightness will be limited, or the device may not power on.


When the Display Saving function is on, brightness is limited to save energy and reduce possible burn-in. Although the brightness can be increased in the OSD by turning Display Saving off, it is recommended to keep Display Saving on, so the possibility burn in is reduced.
