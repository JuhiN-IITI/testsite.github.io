# How can I limit burn-in on an OLED display, such as Wacom Movink?

If the same image is displayed continuously or repeatedly at high brightness on any OLED display, burn-in may occur. This is a characteristic of the OLED material and is not a malfunction of your Movink.


The Display Saving function within your Wacom Movink is turned on by default and limits the maximum brightness of your Movink. The Movink display is considerably bright, but Display Saving can be turned off from the OSD if needed for brighter outside viewing. Wacom recommends that you turn Display Saving back on once you return to a normal viewing environment.


If you are not using the Wacom Movink for a long period of time we recommend that you use a screen saver or turn off the display. OS systems tray is an example of a static image where burn in is common. Active change to the display picture will limit burn in potential. You may also consider changing to "Dark Mode" within your OS as a black background.
