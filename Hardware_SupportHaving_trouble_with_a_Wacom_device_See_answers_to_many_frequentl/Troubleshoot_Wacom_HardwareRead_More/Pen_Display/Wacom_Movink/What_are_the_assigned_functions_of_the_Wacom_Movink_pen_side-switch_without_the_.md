# What are the assigned functions of the Wacom Movink pen side-switch without the Wacom driver installed?

The driver installation is not required for Windows OS, Android OS and ChromeOS. In this case, the pen switches work as follows:
1st switch (close to the pen tip) - Right click
2nd switch - Eraser
3rd switch - Eraser


Installing the Wacom driver allows you to experience the full range of Wacom Movink's capabilities on Windows OS and allows for complete customization, including the ExpressKeys. On compatible Android and ChromeOS devices, a driver is not required.
