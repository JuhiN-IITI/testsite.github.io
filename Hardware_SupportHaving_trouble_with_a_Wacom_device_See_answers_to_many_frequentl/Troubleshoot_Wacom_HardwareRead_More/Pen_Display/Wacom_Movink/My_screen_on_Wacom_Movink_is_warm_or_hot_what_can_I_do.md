# My screen on Wacom Movink is warm or hot, what can I do?

Wacom Movink uses OLED technology and its normal for the display surface to become warmer to the touch when most of the visible display shows a white color. To lower the heat, lower the brightness of the display or limit the amount of white space displaying. Use of Dark Mode via your Operating System settings may be another good option.
