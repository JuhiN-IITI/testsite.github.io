# What is the max resolution the Wacom Converter supports?

The Wacom Converter supports resolutions up to 3840x2160 at 60Hz. However, the actual resolution you can set will depend on the maximum resolution supported by your connected pen display, computer and cables.


The Wacom Converter also supports RGB 10-bit color depth. However, when using a 3840x2160 resolution, it is limited to RGB 8-bit. The same limitation applies if your pen display does not support RGB 10-bit.


Note: The Wacom Converter does not support interlaced signals.
