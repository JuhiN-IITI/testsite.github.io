# Do I need to install the Wacom driver with Movink?

macOS - The Wacom driver installation is required to use Wacom Movink with macOS.


Windows - You can also use Wacom Movink with a Windows computer without the driver, however for the full experience, including customizing the ExpressKeys; we recommend installing the driver.


Android and ChromeOS - On compatible devices, a driver is not required. For a list of compatible devices see here.
