# How do I change settings of the Touch keys on Wacom Movink?

Touch and Express keys are located on the Wacom Movink to enhance your work flow and allow you to customize actions to your preference. Installing the Wacom driver will allow access to the Wacom center control panel and in turn you can fully control the functionality of these keys.


(Note: Touch keys are not available on Android/ChromeOS.)
