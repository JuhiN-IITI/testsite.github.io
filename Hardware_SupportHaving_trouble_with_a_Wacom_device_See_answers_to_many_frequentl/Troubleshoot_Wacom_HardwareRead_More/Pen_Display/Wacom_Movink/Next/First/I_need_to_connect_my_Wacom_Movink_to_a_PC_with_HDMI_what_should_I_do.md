# I need to connect my Wacom Movink to a PC with HDMI, what should I do?

While the Wacom Movink primarily relies on a USB-C connection for both power and display, there's an upcoming solution for those who prefer HDMI connectivity.




Here's what you'll need:


A Wacom converter: This dedicated adapter is designed to facilitate the HDMI connection between your Movink and your PC. Once you have the converter, follow these steps:

Connect the converter:


• Plug one end of the HDMI cable into your PC's HDMI port.
• Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to the HDMI input on the Wacom converter.
• Use the USB-C cable to connect the Wacom converter to the USB-C port on your Movink.

Power up:


• Ensure your PC is powered on.
• Power on your Wacom Movink using the power button on the device.

Driver installation:


• Download and install the latest Wacom drivers for your operating system from the official Wacom website. This will ensure optimal performance and functionality.
