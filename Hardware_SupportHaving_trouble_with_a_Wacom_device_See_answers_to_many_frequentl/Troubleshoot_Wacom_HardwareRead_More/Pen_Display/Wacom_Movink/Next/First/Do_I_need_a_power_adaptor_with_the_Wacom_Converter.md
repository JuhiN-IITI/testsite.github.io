# Do I need a power adaptor with the Wacom Converter?

The Wacom Converter works with both Wacom Movink (DTH135) and Wacom One displays (DTC121/DTH134). The Wacom Converter does not contain a power source and Wacom Movink does not include a power adapter so one is required. For Wacom Movink and Wacom One displays to achieve the maximum power capacity, we recommend using the AC adapter designed for the Wacom One displays (model ACK44514) for optimal performance and is available on Wacom eStore. If you choose to use your own power adapter, we recommend a USB PD-compatible AC adapter with at least 24W (9V/2.67A) output.


For use with other pen displays - Bypass the Wacom converter and use of the original power adapter direct to the pen display.


Important Note: The Wacom Converter will not supply power to your computer.
