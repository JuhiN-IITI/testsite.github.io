# What is the White Color Target of Wacom Movink, and how might it match other displays?

The color of the Wacom Movink display is calibrated during production. OLED displays looks more greenish compared to LCD displays, even if it’s calibrated to same color coordinate. This issue is a result of differences between spectral sensitivity of the human eye and the color matching function defined by CIE1931 which is used widely as standard monitor.



The offset value (Δx＝-0.002,Δｙ=－0.0１0) is determined using the latest color matching function defined by CIE170-2 (10degree field). In all color modes except Native mode the white color is calibrated using the offset value.
