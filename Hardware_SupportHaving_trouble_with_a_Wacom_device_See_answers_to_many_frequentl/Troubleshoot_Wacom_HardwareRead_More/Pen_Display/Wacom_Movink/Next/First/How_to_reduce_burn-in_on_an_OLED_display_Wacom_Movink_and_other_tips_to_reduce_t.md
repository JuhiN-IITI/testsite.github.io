# How to reduce burn-in on an OLED display (Wacom Movink) and other tips to reduce the burn-in risk.

If the same image is displayed continuously or repeatedly at high brightness on any OLED display, burn-in may occur. This is a characteristic of the OLED material and is not a malfunction. If you are not using the Wacom Movink for a long period of time, we recommend that you use a screen saver or turn off the display. Also please make sure the Display Saving function is turned on as this will help diminish possible burn-in. The Display Saving function of Wacom Movink is ON by default.
