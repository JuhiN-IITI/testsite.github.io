# The Wacom Converter is not working, what do I do?

Ensure Proper Cable Connections
Confirm that all cables are securely connected to the appropriate ports.

Specifically, make sure the HDMI cable is plugged into a port on your PC that supports video output.
If the Issue Persists


Disconnect all cables connected to the Wacom Converter.
Reconnect the USB cable and HDMI cable with PC and the pen display first, and reconnect the AC adapter, followed by the pen display.
If the AC adapter is not connected to the Wacom Converter and the pen display is supplying power (image2), disconnect the pen display and then reconnect it.
