# What is the Wacom Rollup case for?

The Movink Rollup case is designed as a convenient way to store your Pro Pen 3, USB-C cable and another pen when you travel. We recommend you store the Pro Pen 3 tip down to protect the nib.


Wacom rollup case is only available in the Wacom Movink Accessory bundle. Please check it out at the Wacom eStore.
