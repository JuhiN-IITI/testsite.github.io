# The Wacom One Pen (CP91300B2Z) does not draw or ink with pressure sensitivity.

On Windows or Mac OS, first, make sure the Wacom Driver is installed. The display will not function fully without the driver installed. To install the latest driver, visit the Product Resource page here. Some applications also require that you turn on the pressure capabilities within the application, or with the selected tool before the pen will respond as pressure-sensitive. Verify that your application supports pressure sensitivity before using it.Â
