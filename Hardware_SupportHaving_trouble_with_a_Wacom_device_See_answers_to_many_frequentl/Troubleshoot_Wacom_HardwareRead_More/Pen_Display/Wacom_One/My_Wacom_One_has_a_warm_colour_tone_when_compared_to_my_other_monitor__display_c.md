# My Wacom One has a warm colour tone when compared to my other monitor / display, can I change this?

The Wacom One has three settings that can be used to control the colour temperature: 5000 (default), 6500 and 9300. To change the colour temperature on your Wacom One:

Open the Wacom Desktop Center application
Click on Display Settings which will open the Wacom Display Settings window.
Click on the drop down menu next to Colour Temperature as shown above and choose your desired value.



A brief explanation of the colour temperature values:

The default setting of 5000 sets the Wacom One display to a warmer colour temperature
The middle setting of 6500 will provide a more neutral colour temperature
The higher setting of 9300 sets the Wacom One display to a cooler colour temperature
