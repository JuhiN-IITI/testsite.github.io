# What should I do if the Wacom One (DTC133) does not work after connecting to my Android device?

First, make sure the Android device you have is compatible with Wacom One, and the cables and connectors are all connected firmly and correctly to the corresponding ports. Â 


Next, if the unit is still not working after excluding all the possible compatibility and connection issues, long press the power button on Wacom One for 6 seconds and Wacom One will then be switching to the Android mode. If the issue continues, contact our support team using the connect button below.
