# What is the pen behavior like on Wacom One with Chromebook devices?

Due to Chrome OS specifications, the pen behaves like a touchscreen on Wacom One when it is connected to a Chromebook device. Therefore, tapping on a file immediately opens it. If you press-and-hold on a file, it will become highlighted after around 1 second and display an icon next to the pen. You can either release the pen and then tap on other files to select them, or drag the pen to move them.
