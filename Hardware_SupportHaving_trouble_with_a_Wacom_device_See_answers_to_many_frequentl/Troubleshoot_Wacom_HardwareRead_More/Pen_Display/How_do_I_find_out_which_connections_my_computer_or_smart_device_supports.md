# How do I find out which connections my computer or smart device supports?

The easiest way, is by simply looking at the ports on your computer.


If you are not sure, please check your computer or smart device's manual or contact the manufacturer directly. 


Below you will find a few examples of ports commonly available on computers and smart devices: 
USB-C


USB comes in many specifications. Some ports will only support charging while other will support data, video signal and even power delivery (meaning you also get power on your device). In some situations, it may be referred to as "Thunderbolt 3 or 4" or simply "Thunderbolt"
Please check with your device's manufacturer for the exact specifications. 


 
Standard USB-C


Could be just for charging devices or for data and video transmission as well. If there are no identifying icons around, please check with the manufacturer. 





USB-C Power delivery


If your USB-C port has a logo similar to this, then it should support Power Delivery but might not support video transmission.

 
USB-C DisplayPort Alt mode


If your USB-C port has a logo like this, then it supports DisplayPort Alternate Mode. This this port can both send and receive a video signal.
