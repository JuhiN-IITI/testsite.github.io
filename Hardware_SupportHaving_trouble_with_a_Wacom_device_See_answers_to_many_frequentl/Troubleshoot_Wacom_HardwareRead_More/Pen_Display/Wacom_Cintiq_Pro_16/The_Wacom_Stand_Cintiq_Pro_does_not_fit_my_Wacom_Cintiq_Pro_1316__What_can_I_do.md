# The Wacom Stand Cintiq Pro does not fit my Wacom Cintiq Pro 13/16 . What can I do?

You may need to replace the clips on your Cintiq Pro 13/16. Please use the clip kit provided in the box, under the Quick Start Guide, which includes:

4 clips, 
4 screws, 
1 Torx screwdriver 
1 instruction card


Carefully remove the clips, small screws and screwdriver from the package.
Using the screwdriver, loosen all 4 screws on the back of the device.
Carefully push on the end of the clip furthest from the screw opening to lift the clip off the back of the device.
Insert all 4 new clips first to ensure you do not accidentally drop the screws into the device.
Insert the new screws and tighten until you feel some resistance.
Attach the Wacom Stand to your Cintiq Pro. 



CAUTION: DO NOT overtighten as this may strip the screw and damage your device!
