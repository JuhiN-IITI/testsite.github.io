# Why is it hard to double click my pen?

First, make sure that you are quickly tapping the display screen twice in the same place on the pen display tablet’s active area; we recommend using the side switch to double-click. If you’re still having trouble, open the Wacom Tablet Control Panel and click on the “Pen” tab, then increase the “Tip Double Click Distance." This expands the area that the system is looking at to constitute a double click, as opposed to 2 separate clicks.
