# My cables are getting pinched by my monitor arm, when using the Wacom VESA Mount is there a better way to route the cables?

To avoid the potential of pinched cables, follow the cable routing instructions below:

Route all cables through the grommet holes and connect them to the Wacom Cintiq Pro (or Cintiq Pro Engine), then attach the VESA Mount to the Cintiq Pro.
Attach VESA Mount to Cintiq Pro.
Attach Cintiq Pro with VESA Mount to your arm or mount.
Make sure to follow all cable routing instructions for the arm or mount you are using.
Use cable ties (included with the Cintiq Pro VESA Mount) to route the cables and keep them away from pinch points.
Make sure the cables have enough slack for the Cintiq Pro to move and rotate as you want.
