# I lost some of my screws to install my Cintiq Pro to my Flex Arm bracket / VESA Cintiq Pro Mount. Where can I get replacement screws?

All screws and drivers are standard metric screws that are readily available in hardware stores. Please check your Quick Start Guide to determine which particular screw and size you need to replace. You may also be able to contact Wacom Tech Support.
