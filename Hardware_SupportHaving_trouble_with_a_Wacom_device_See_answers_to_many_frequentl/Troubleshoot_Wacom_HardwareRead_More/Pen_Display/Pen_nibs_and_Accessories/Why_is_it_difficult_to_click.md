# Why is it difficult to click?

You may be able to fix this by opening the Wacom Tablet Control Panel and clicking on the “Pen” tab, then setting your pen to use a lighter tip feel by moving the slider towards “soft.” You can also select the “Details” button and decrease the “Sensitivity and Click Threshold” settings.
