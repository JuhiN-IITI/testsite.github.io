# What does the LED of Wacom One 12 Touch(DTC121) mean?

When your Wacom One 12 is on, the power LED stays dim white; the LED turns off when your device is off. The LED blinks slowly while your device is standby or is in power saving mode.

Same with TITAN comment. FYI for detail behavior.

*After 5 second, turn darker (Brightness change from 100% to 50%)

*If display is showed after blink with single USB-C connection, Wacom One is active with low power mode. For full function please connect with AC adapter.
