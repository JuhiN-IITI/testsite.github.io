# How do I connect the Wacom One 12 (DTC121) and Wacom One 13 Touch (DTH134) to a computer?

After you remove the Wacom One from the box and are ready to begin using it, connect it to your computer using the steps in option A or B, depending on your computer's setup.

Note: "Wacom One" refers to both the Wacom One 12 and Wacom One 13 touch.


 

Connection Options

Option A: Connect to a computer with a USB-C port that supports graphics output
Option B: Connect to a computer with USB-A and HDMI ports



If you are not sure which ports are available on your computer and don't know what to chose, see our Guide here: How do I find out which connections my computer or smart device supports?


Option A: Connect to a computer with a USB-C port that supports graphics output

Note: To save energy, Wacom recommends using option A to connect the Wacom One to your computer.

Insert one end of the USB-C to C cable into either one of the two USB-C ports on the Wacom One and insert the other end into a USB-C port that supports graphics output on your computer.

Turn on the Wacom One.



Install the driver.
Important: If the power status LED is blinking quickly (or if nothing displays on the Wacom One screen) after completing steps 1 through 3, continue with steps 4 through 6 to connect the power adapter. This will provide the additional power that your computer requires.



Assemble the Power adapter by attaching the plug plate to the adapter and then sliding it down until you hear a click.

Power adapters vary based on region.



Insert one end of the USB-C to C cable into the power adapter and insert the other end into the available USB-C port on the Wacom One.



Plug the Power adapter into a power source.






Option B: Connect to a computer with USB-A and HDMI ports


Assemble the Power adapter by attaching the plug plate to the adapter and then sliding it down until you hear a click.

Power adapters vary based on region.



Attach the power adapter to the 3-in-1 cable.



Insert the USB-C cable into either one of the two USB-C ports on the Wacom One.



Insert the USB-A and HDMI cables into their respective ports on your computer.



Plug the Power adapter into a power source.





Install the driver.
