# Does Wacom One 13Touch(DTH134) offer multi-touch?

The DTH134 has the touch function as well as pen input. 10 fingers multi-touch is possible. The DTH134 has the touch On/Off switch on top of the product to prevent mis-operation if touch is not used in operation.


Also the DTH134 has the palm rejection function. When the pen is detected by the DTH134, the touch sensor is deactivated for a temporary period of time to prevent mixing up the pen input and the finger input.
