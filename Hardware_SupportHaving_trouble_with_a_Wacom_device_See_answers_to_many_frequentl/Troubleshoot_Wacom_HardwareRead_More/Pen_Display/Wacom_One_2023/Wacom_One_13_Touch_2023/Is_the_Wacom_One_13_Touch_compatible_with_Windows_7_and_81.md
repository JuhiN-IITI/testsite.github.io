# Is the Wacom One 13 Touch compatible with Windows 7 and 8.1?

No, Wacom does not support this setup and the driver is not compatible. However, the Wacom One(DTH134) can only be used with Windows 7/8.1 without the tablet driver, but please note that there will be some limitations, such as the inability to change the side switch settings, etc.
