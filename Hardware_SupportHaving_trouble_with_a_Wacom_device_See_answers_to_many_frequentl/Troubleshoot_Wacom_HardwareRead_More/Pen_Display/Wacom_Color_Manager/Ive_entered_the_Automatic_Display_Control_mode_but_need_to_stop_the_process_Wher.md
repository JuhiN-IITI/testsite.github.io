# I’ve entered the Automatic Display Control mode, but need to stop the process. Where’s the Stop or Cancel button?

The Automatic Display Control (ADC) feature can take a number of minutes with the Cintiq 27, due to the very complete control of the hardware offered. The current version of the software doesn’t have a cancel button available until the ADC feature completes. We would recommend that you allow the ADC process to complete to avoid having the display end up in an unstable color condition.
