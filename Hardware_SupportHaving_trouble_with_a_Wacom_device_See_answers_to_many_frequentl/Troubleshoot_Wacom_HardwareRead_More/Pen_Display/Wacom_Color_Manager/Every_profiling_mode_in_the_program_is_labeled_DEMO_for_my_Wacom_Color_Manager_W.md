# Every profiling mode in the program is labeled “DEMO” for my Wacom Color Manager. Why is that?

Until you connect the Wacom Color Calibrator to a USB port, the software will show DEMO for all functions. Once you connect the Wacom Color Calibrator device, the Display and Projector icons will become active. You could also connect an X-Rite i1Pro or i1PRO2 spectrophotometer to enable display profiling.
