# What is soft proofing and why should I soft proof (Wacom Color Manager)?

"In an effective color management workflow, you want to build profiles for all the devices in your workflow. At a minimum, you'll want to profile your monitor, so you can accurately see what is in the digital file. But, if your workflow is for print, for example, you would also want to make sure you were using the correct profiles for your printer. These can usually be found on your printer manufacturers website or on the printer paper manufacturersâ€™ web site if you are not using paper made for your printer. These profiles accurately define how your printer and its inks will respond to the paper type you are using. Soft proofing allows you to see a representation of what the printer profile will give as a result. It will always be slightly different than the Cintiq Pro view as the Cintiq Pro has a wider color gamut than most printers on the market. The major benefit of using soft proofing is that creates a much more accurate representation of what will actually appear on paper. Keep in mind that images on a display are created by pushing light through pixels, whereas images on paper reflect light, and will usually appear darker than the image on Cintiq Pro. Soft proofing your images is a very simple, quick and free way to verify that you're going to like the printed result when you use that profile. We strongly suggest you review soft proofing instructions for the image editing software you use.
