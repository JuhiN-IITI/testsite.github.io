# I’m clicking on “Create and Save Profile” but nothing’s happening. Why?

In the workflow selector across the bottom of the Wacom Color Manager software, you can jump between any of the steps in the workflow as required. The most common cause of not being able to save a profile would be accidentally selecting the profile icon before you completed the Measurement step. Click on the Measurement icon and after the measurements have been completed, you’ll be able to save the profile.
