# What "Technology Type" should I choose when calibrating a display other than my Wacom Cintiq Pro and the Wacom Color Manager?

Wacom Color Manager will-select from a number of known displays using a system file installed with the program. If the specific display is unknown, it uses our default setting (White LED). However, if the user knows that their particular display uses another backlight technology type, they can change this in the “Preferences” screen to get slightly better results.
