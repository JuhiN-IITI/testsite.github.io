# In Measurement Instrument, it says “i1PRO not found”.

On the home screen of the program, you choose if you are using a Wacom Calibrator, or a different device, such as an i1Pro/i1PRO2. Please go back to the home screen and change to Wacom Color Calibrator. You will see the image change to match your measurement device’s appearance.
