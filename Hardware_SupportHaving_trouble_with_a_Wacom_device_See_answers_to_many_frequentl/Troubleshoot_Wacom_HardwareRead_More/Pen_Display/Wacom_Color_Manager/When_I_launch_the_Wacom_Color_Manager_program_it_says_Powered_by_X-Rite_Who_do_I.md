# When I launch the Wacom Color Manager program, it says “Powered by X-Rite”. Who do I contact for assistance?

The Wacom Color Manager software is fully supported by Wacom. X-Rite color technology is used by this program, and your measurement device was manufactured by X-Rite. But please contact Wacom support for all questions or concerns.
