# When calibrating a Wacom Cintiq Pro with Wacom Color Manager what does the "Display : Uniformity" feature do?

Display "Uniformity” allows a user to measure the monitor’s ability to display color consistently across its screen. Data is collected by measuring the center and then at eight additional points around the perimeter of the screen. Feedback is reported in luminance difference (dL*) as well as color difference (dE). Using the Uniformity feature should provide valuable information that could help users with multiple displays make an informed decision on which one to use for their color-critical work. Note: selecting to include "Uniformity" in your profiling process will enable Uniformity in the OnScreenDisplay controls for your Cintiq Pro automatically.
