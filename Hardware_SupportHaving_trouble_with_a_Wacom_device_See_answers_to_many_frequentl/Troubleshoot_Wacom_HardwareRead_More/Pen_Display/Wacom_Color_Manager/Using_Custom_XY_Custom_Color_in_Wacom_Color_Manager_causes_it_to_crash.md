# Using Custom X,Y (Custom Color) in Wacom Color Manager causes it to crash

Yes, the default settings for the x.y values in the Custom X,Y selection are inaccurate. Please enter valid x,y values and try the calibration again. Also, choosing “Default” checkbox will set a median x,y value. Both will keep the WCM from crashing. Wacom is currently working on an update for this issue.
