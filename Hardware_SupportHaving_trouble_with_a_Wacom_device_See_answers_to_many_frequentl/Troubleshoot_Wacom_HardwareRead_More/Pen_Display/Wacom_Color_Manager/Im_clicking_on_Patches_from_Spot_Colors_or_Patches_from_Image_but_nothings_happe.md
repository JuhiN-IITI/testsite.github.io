# I’m clicking on “Patches from Spot Colors”, or “Patches from Image”, but nothing’s happening. Why?

You can import specific colors from images (TIFF or JPEG) or from spot color files saved from other X-Rite software (CxF file format). Clicking on the icon to import those values is not sufficient. You would need to select those image or spot color files by file name. Please note that this isn’t a requirement, but an option for a customized display profile.
