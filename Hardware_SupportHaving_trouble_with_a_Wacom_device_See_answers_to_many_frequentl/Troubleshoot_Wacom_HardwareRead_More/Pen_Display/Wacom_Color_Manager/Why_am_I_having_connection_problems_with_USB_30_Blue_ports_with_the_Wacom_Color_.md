# Why am I having connection problems with USB 3.0 (Blue ports) with the Wacom Color Manager?

Even though USB 3.0 was designed to be backwards compatible with USB 2.0 devices, we have seen some connection issues with USB 2.0 devices like the Wacom Color Manager when connected to USB 3.0. The recommended port for the Wacom Color Manager is either directly to a USB 2.0(black) port, or to use the USB-A port on the back of the Cintiq Pro. If necessary, other troubleshooting could include a restart of the computer, try another USB port (USB 2.0 if available), turn off or set exclusions in virus protection software, try a powered USB hub.
