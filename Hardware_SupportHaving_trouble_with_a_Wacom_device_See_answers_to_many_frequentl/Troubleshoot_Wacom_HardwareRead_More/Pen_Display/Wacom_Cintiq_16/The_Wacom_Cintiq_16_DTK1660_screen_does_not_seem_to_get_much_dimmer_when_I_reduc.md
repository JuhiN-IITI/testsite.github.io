# The Wacom Cintiq 16 (DTK1660) screen does not seem to get much dimmer when I reduce the brightness from the default setting. Is this normal?

This is normal behavior. You will see that the brightness change is more noticeable from the default setting of 75 to 100 than it is in the opposite direction of 75 to 0.
