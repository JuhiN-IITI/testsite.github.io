# The image on my Wacom Cintiq 16 DTK-1660 has low contrast. Is there a way I can improve it?

If the Cintiq’s image is faded or does not have enough contrast, the quantization range setting of your PC’s video card (GPU) might not be set properly.
 Please follow the steps below to check your system’s settings.

Open your PC’s GPU control panel. Note: Each manufacture offers a different control so your steps may vary. In example to open Intel’s control panel, follow these steps. 
  
You can open the Intel® Graphics Control Panel in two different ways:  
    
In desktop mode, right-click on the Desktop. Then, select Intel® Graphics Settings. 
      

 
 You can also open the Intel Graphics Control Panel with a hot-key combination. On your keyboard, simultaneously press CTRL+ALT+F12.
 
 
Once your GPU settings are open, go to the display section and select the Wacom Cintiq 16.
Locate general settings and select “Full Range” under Quantization Range for the display. Below is an example of the settings offered in the Intel control panel.
