# My Wacom Cintiq 16 (DTK-1660) screen feels rougher than when I purchased the product. What can I do to improve this situation?

With extended use, the screen is susceptible to accumulate debris and particles that can be felt while drawing. Use a damp cloth to clean the screen and remove the particles. Keeping your tablet surface clean will help avoid scratches.
