# No Video on Cintiq 21UX

On a PC

Make sure your Cintiq is set to "Attached" 
  
Right click on desktop
Select "properties" (or "personalize" and "display settings" in vista)
Go to settings tab
Right click grayed-out screen symbol
Select Attach and click Apply

 
If you still don't see anything, be sure that the connection to the computer corresponds to the switch on your Cintiq. 
  
If you're using the blue connection, switch should be set to VGA
If you're using the white connection, the switch should be set to DVI
Before changing the switch, shut down and turn everything off, turn switch and restart everything.
 
If you're getting a message saying "Signal Out of Range" 
  
Confirm that your Cintiq is set to 1600X1200 and at 60hz
If you have trouble with that you may need to consult the user's guide of your video card
 
If your Cintiq displays nothing but a steady blue light, either your Cintiq's display is set to all black, or you'll need to click Contact Us below to contact our support team.
