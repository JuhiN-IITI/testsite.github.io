# Why does my Intuos4 Pen work with a compatible Intuos tablet, but not a compatible Cintiq tablet?

This issue is likely caused by a change in pens, from KP-501E to KP-501E-01, when the Cintiq 21UX (DTK-2100) was introduced. All Cintiq interactive screen displays (DTK-2100 and newer) need to use at least the -01 pens in order to function properly. You can determine if youâ€™re using an older model from the logo next to the eraser: The KP-*01E (old model) only has one Wacom logo next to the eraser, while the KP-*01E-01 has two Wacom logos on the ring next to the eraser. Please also keep in mind that the driver version needs to be 6.1.3 or higher to recognize the -01 series pens.
