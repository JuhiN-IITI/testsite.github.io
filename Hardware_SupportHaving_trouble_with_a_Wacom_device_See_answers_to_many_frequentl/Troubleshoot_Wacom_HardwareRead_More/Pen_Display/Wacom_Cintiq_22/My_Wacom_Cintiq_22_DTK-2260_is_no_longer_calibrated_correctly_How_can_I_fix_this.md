# My Wacom Cintiq 22 (DTK-2260) is no longer calibrated correctly. How can I fix this?

Your Wacom Cintiq 22 can be re-calibrated from within the Wacom Tablet Properties utility. Open the Wacom Tablet Properties and select a pen from the Tool list. Then, choose the Calibrate tab and press the "Calibrate..." button. If the issue continues, you may need to do a full reinstall of your driver.
