The table below contains the most common symptoms. If you don't find something relatable, see the troubleshooting steps further below. 



Symptom
Issue
Solution




The Pen selects/drags everything
The pen does not "let go" of the cursor
All my pen strokes are joined together


Pen pressure sensor stays active at all times


Remove the pen Nib from the pen and let it rest on the pen stand overnight
Reinsert the nib and test the pen again
Use the Diagnose tool to confirm if issue is fixed
If the persists, the pen needs to be replaced - Contact Customer Support for further advise
 






Pen is lagging
There is a delay between the pen movement and the cursor on the display




Using a slower data connection (Bluetooth)
Drawing software processes the stroke slower



 



If using Bluetooth - see our FAQ How to optimize Bluetooth performance with Wacom Tablets

Use wired connection for a faster and more stable connection - connect directly to your computer avoiding any adapters if possible
Check if drawing a stroke with a different drawing app shows the same issue
Make sure there is no "stroke smoothing" tool active with your drawing application. Example: Stroke Smoothing in Photoshop
Check for performance recommendations for your application.

This is not related to the Wacom device, the driver settings or version, or even the operating system.

Check pressure settings recommendations from the developer of the drawing application
In Photoshop, check brush smoothing options and try lowering the “Minimum Diameter” slider.
