# How can I set up a non-warranty repair?

If a Wacom product requires a repair due to physical damage or other non-manufacturer defect, or the warranty period has expired, it may still be able to be serviced by Wacom as a non-warranty RMA for the repair fee. 


 


How to Start


The first step is to visit our FAQ  “How do I set up a repair or RMA“ and try some of the solutions for many common issues. If the issue continues after troubleshooting or if you would like to troubleshoot with Wacom, contact support using the create a ticket button below. Please have your tablet’s model number, serial number ready.


 


Repair Fee


A repair fee applies only to repairs and replacement completed by Wacom and is subject to change upon inspection. The repair estimate will be provided by Wacom Support before the repair services are set up. For exchange orders, we will replace your device or accessory with a similar Wacom refurbished product.


 


Repair Warranty   


If we find that the same part of the repaired part (subject to Non-Warranty repair) needs to be repaired again due to reasons other than physical damage or other non-manufacturer defect, repaired part warranty is provided for 3 months from the repair completion date.  In the case of non-warranty repair due to physical damage or other non-manufacture defect while the product warranty period has not expired yet, the repair part warranty is provided for longer of 3 months from the repair completion date or until the warranty period expires. We will repair it free of charge for such repaired party warranty period.
