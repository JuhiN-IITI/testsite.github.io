# How does a non-warranty RMA work?

If a product requires a repair due to physical damage or other non-manufacturer defect, or the warranty period has expired, it may still be able to be serviced by Wacom as a non-warranty RMA. If you feel that you have a problem with a product that is outside of warranty, please contact WacomÂ Customer Support.
