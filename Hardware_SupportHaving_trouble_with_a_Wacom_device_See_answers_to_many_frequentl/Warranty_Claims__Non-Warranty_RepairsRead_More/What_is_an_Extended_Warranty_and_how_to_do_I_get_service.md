# What is an Extended Warranty and how to do I get service?

Wacom offers an extended warranty through a third party company called Extend (United States only at this time). The extended warranty offers hardware service past Wacom’s original manufacturer warranty.  


The extended warranty needs to be purchased through the Wacom Estore at the same time of your product purchase on the Wacom estore. Any service claim while the product is under Wacom’s manufacturer warranty is handled with Wacom support, see here for more. After the manufacturer warranty had ended and within the extended warranty time frame, service claims are handed through the third party warranty company Extend.


Extend can be contacted through their customer portal here, or by calling their support team at 1-877-248-7707
