Packing of Products


Please use the original packaging where possible and include the defective product or accessories only. If the original product packaging is not available, please use a packing method that best protects the product from any shipping damage. To avoid delays and for cross-checking, all original parts and accessories should be included. Please do not send accessories which were not included in the original box.　


If you are returning a Pen Display which is mounted on a stand, you must remove it from the stand before packing it. If you need to return your stand as well as the display, the display and the stand must be packaged separately.


Any product damage will be the responsibility of the customer, as damage is not covered under warranty.


 


Avoid Losing Data


During the process of repair or service, some or all of your apps, images, photos, music and other information (including software and user generated data) on the product may be lost.
