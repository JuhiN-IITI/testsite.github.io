# What are the quality standards (pixel policies) for Pen display tablet?

Each interactive pen display LCD panel is produced under very stringent quality standards. However, production techniques cannot guarantee a perfect display, and some panels may exhibit a certain number of sub-pixels that show an incorrect color.


Understanding a pixel, and sub-pixel defects


What is a pixel?


A pixel is a single point in a graphic image. LCD panel monitors display pictures by dividing the display screen into thousands (or millions) of pixels, arranged in rows and columns.


The pixels are placed close together so that they appear connected.


A full pixel is a combination of one red, one green, and one blue sub-pixel.


 


What are sub-pixel defects?


A sub-pixel defect is referred to as a dot defect, and there are two kinds of possible defects:

The “Bright dot” sub-pixel defect, which is always displaying a colored red, green, or blue spot on the display.
The “Dark” dot” sub-pixel defect which is always displaying a black dot on the display.





Understanding quality standards



Under the Wacom’s manufacturer limited warranty, the specifications for the maximum number of sub-pixel defects that are deemed to be acceptable for each model of LCD panel (except for business use) are:
