# How to send a Wacom product in to be repaired?

Create a ticket to obtain RMA


The first step is to visit our FAQ  “How do I set up a repair or RMA“ and try some of the solutions for many common issues. If the issue continues after troubleshooting or if you would like to troubleshoot with Wacom Support, simply click the "Create a ticket" button below to fill out the needed information. It is located at the bottom of every page on the Wacom Support website. After receiving your request, we will contact you by phone or email to further troubleshoot your issue, and if needed issue a Repair Merchandise Authorization or RMA for your Wacom product. Please have your tablet’s model number, serial number and a copy of the sales receipt ready.


 


Packing of Repaired Products


Please use the original packaging where possible and include the defective product or accessories only. If the original product packaging is not available, please use a packing method that best protects the product from any shipping damage. To avoid delays and for cross-checking, all original parts and accessories should be included. Please do not send accessories which were not included in the original box.　


If you are returning a Pen Display which is mounted on a stand, you must remove it from the stand before packing it. If you need to return your stand as well as the display, the display and the stand must be packaged separately.


Any product damage will be the responsibility of the customer, as damage is not covered under warranty.


 


Avoid Losing Data


During the process of repair or service, some or all of your apps, images, photos, music and other information (including software and user generated data) on the product may be lost. Also, Wacom may re-install your product’s original software configuration while we are performing any repair or service, which will result in the deletion of your software, apps, images, photos, music, data and other information. Wacom does not take a backup of your software, apps, images, photos, music, data or other information prior to commencing any repair or service. To avoid the loss your software, apps, images, photos, music data and other information, you should take a full backup and store the backup on another device prior to sending the product. You will need to re-install your software, apps, images, photos, music, data or other information once we return your product to you (or any replacement that we may send you).
