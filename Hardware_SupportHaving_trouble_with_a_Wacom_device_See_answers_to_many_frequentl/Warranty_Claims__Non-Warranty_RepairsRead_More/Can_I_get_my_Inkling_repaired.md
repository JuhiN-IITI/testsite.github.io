# Can I get my Inkling repaired?

Unfortunately, spare parts aren’t manufactured for Inkling, therefore it can’t be repaired, and will need to be replaced. If the device is no longer under warranty, or the warranty doesn’t cover the issue, it will be necessary to purchase a new Inkling. The warranty period in the United States is 2 years.
