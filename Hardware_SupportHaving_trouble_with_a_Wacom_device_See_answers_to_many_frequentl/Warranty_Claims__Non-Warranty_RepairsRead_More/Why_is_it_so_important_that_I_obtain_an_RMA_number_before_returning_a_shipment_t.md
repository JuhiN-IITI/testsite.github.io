# Why is it so important that I obtain an RMA number before returning a shipment that I tried to cancel?

An RMA number is required for all items being returned to, or sent to, Wacom. This is needed so that our receiving teams may properly identify the item, and process it accordingly. Products arriving at Wacom without an RMA number will face delays while the reason for return is researched and identified. If you would like to return an item to Wacom for service, exchange, or refund, please be sure to contact Wacom Customer Support.
