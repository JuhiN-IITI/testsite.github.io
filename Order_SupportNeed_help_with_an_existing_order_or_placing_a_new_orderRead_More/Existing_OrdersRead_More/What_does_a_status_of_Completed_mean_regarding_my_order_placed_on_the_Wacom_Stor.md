# What does a status of 'Completed' mean, regarding my order placed on the Wacom Store?

A status of ‘Completed’ means that the order process is complete. At this time the product has been picked, shipped, and the payment is settled. If you have additional questions, please contact Wacom Customer Support and have your order number available.
