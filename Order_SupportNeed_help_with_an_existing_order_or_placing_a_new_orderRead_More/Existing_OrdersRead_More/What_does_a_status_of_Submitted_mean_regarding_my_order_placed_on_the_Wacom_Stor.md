# What does a status of 'Submitted' mean, regarding my order placed on the Wacom Store?

A status of ‘Submitted’ means that the order has been placed, and will begin processing to ship. It has not yet shipped however. If you have additional questions, please contact Wacom Customer Support and have your order number available.
