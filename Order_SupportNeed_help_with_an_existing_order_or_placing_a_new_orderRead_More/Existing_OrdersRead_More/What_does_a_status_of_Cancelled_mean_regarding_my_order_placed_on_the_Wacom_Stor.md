# What does a status of 'Cancelled' mean, regarding my order placed on the Wacom Store?

A status of ‘Cancelled’ means that the order has been cancelled and will not process or ship. In most cases, funds that were authorized as part of the credit transaction will be made available within 24-48 hours, though it can depend on the financial institution for when this will be reflected. If you have additional questions, please contact Wacom Customer Support and have your order number available.
