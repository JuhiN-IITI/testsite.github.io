Once an order has been submitted on the Wacom Store, it cannot be modified. You can attempt to cancel the order by following the steps below:

Login to your account and select "My Orders."
Select your order from the orders list.
If your order can be cancelled, a "Cancel Order" Button will appear at the top of the order summary page.



If you placed your order with a guest account. Please contact Wacom support and have your order number available.Â
