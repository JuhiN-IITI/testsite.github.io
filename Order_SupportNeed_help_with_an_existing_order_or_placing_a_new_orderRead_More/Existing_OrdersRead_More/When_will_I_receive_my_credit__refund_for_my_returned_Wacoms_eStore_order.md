# When will I receive my credit / refund for my returned Wacom's eStore order?

You can expect the credit / refund back, for your returned Wacom eStore order, within 10 business days of the date Wacom receives the return. 
That said, depending on the payment method you've used, once the credit / refund is sent back to you, seeing this reflected on your end can vary according to the processing speeds of your payment method.

If you haven't returned your order yet but you are looking on how to do it, please see the next article:
How do I return my order that was placed on the Wacom-Store?
