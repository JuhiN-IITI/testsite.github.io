# How do I return my order that was placed on the Wacom Store?

Only products purchased from the Wacom Estore can be returned for a refund.


If you placed your order via guest checkout, please contact Wacom Support to set up the return and have your Wacom Order number ready.


If you placed your order using your WacomID, follow the steps below:

Login to your Wacom account and go to "My Orders."  
Select "View Order" for the order you wish to return and select "Return" from the order summary page.  
On the new return page, select the product you wish to return from the drop-down menu.  
Select the item condition, quantity, and reason for return.
If you are returning multiple products, select the "add product" button at the bottom and see Multiple Boxes

Once all fields are complete, click the "Return" button.



You will then be given your return number. You will also be emailed your return summary and a shipping label to cover the cost of return shipping.


Once we receive your return, you'll receive a confirmation email from us. Expect a credit to your account within 10 Business days from the date of receipt.


 
Multiple Boxes


If you have multiple boxes to return (e.g. a Cintiq Pro 27 and a Stand), please contact Wacom Support to get a shipping label for each individual box.
