# How do I get the tracking number for my order that was placed on the Wacom Store?

Once shipped, a shipment confirmation email will be sent to the email used to place the order. The tracking number can also be found in your account. Please follow the steps below to get the tracking number from your account.

Login to your eStore account and select "My Orders."
Select your order from the orders list.
On the order summary page scroll down to “Shipping Detail.”
Your tracking number is listed there and is also a hyperlink to the shipping carrier’s tracking website.



If you placed your order with a guest account, please contact Wacom support and have your order number ready to locate the tracking number.
