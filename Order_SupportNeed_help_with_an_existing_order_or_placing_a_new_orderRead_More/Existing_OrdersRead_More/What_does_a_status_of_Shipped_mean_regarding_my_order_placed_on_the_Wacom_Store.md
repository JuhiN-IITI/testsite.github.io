# What does a status of 'Shipped' mean, regarding my order placed on the Wacom Store?

A status of ‘Shipped’ means that the order has been picked and shipped from our warehouse. A tracking number should have been sent via an automated email to the email address provided when the order was placed. If you have additional questions, please contact Wacom Customer Support and have your order number available.
