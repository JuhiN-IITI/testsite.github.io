# What does a status of 'In Process' mean, regarding my order place on the Wacom Store?

A status of ‘In Process’ means that the order has been placed, and has started the process to be picked and shipped. It has not yet shipped however. If you have additional questions, please contact Wacom Customer Support and have your order number available.
