# How do I cancel an order that was placed on the Wacom Store?

Depending on what stage an order is at, it may be possible to cancel prior to shipping. To attempt this:

Login to your account and select "My Orders."  
Select your order from the orders list.  
If your order can be cancelled, a "Cancel Order" button will appear at the top of the order summary page.
If you do not see a "Cancel Order" button then the order has moved past the point of being able to be cancelled. Upon receipt of your product, you may request a return for a full refund of the purchase price within 30 days.



If you placed your order with a guest account. Please contact Wacom support and have your order number available. Please note that Wacom cannot guarantee cancellation of an order that has been submitted.
