# What does a status of 'Review' mean, regarding my order placed on the Wacom Store?

For customers all orders placed in Wacom eStore must meet standard fraud prevention criteria for the order to continue into processing. Some orders are randomly screened for additional review as an extra fraud prevention safeguard. This may result in a delay of 1 to 4 business days if your order is selected for review. If you have additional questions, please contact Wacom Customer Support and have your order number available.
