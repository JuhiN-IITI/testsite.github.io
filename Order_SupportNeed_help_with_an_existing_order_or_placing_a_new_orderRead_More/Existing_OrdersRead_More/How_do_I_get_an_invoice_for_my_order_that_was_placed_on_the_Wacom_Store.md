# How do I get an invoice for my order that was placed on the Wacom Store?

An invoice for your Wacom Store order can be found in your account. Please follow the steps below to get the invoice:

Login to your account and select "My Orders."  
Select your order from the orders list.  
On the order summary page, scroll down to “Order Invoice.”
