# Can I change my billing address when using PayPal as a payment method?

No, in most cases the billing address is passed from PayPal to the Wacom eStore. If you want to change your billing address, please log in to your Paypal account and make the update, before placing the order on the Wacom Store. You can, however, change your shipping address directly on the Wacom Store if needed.


If you have any questions please contact Wacom Customer Support using the contact button below.
