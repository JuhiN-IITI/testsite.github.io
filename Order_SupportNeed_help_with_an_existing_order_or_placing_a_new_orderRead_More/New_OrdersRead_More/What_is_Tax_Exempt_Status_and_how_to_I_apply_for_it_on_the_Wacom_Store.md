# What is Tax Exempt Status and how to I apply for it on the Wacom Store?

Depending on the state where you do business and the types of products you buy, your business may qualify for tax exemption. You must apply locally to your state for a sales tax certificate. Once you have an approved sales tax certificate, you may apply for tax exemption on the Wacom Store through your Wacom Account by following the steps below.

Create or login to your Wacom Store account here.
Once logged in, select “Tax Exemption” from the menu on the left side. 
Click “Choose File” and upload your Sales tax Certificate as a PDF document.



Once you submit your form for review, you will get a confirmation email that the file is under review. If the Wacom team has questions or concerns, they will reach out to you via email. Once the certificate is approved, you will receive an approval email, and the instructions to apply tax exemption at checkout.
