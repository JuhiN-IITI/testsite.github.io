# How to I set my Community Alias?

By default your name in the Wacom Community is your full name that you entered when signing up with a Wacom ID. If you wish not to use your own name, you can set a alias to be displayed instead..


Simply click the profile icon on the upper-right side of the page, and then click My profile. 


Select Edit profile and then in the Alias field, enter your user alias, then click OK to save.
