# Why is there no pen calibration function in Wacom Center?

The purpose of the pen calibration feature was three-fold: 1. To allow for manual adjustment if the pen sensor is not properly aligned with the display, 2. To compensate for perceived misalignment of the pen tip and screen cursor due to parallax (gap between pen tip and screen surface), 3. To adjust the screen cursor position relative to the pen tip according to a user’s preference.


Wacom has continuously improved its manufacturing processes and any offset between the display and the pen sensor is extremely small in our current products. We also minimized the parallax on all current products by using very thin cover glass and bonding it to the screen. These improvements addressed the first two reasons to the point where a manual pen calibration will almost always result in a worse pen alignment than the factory calibration.


In order to support different user preferences for the screen cursor location relative to the pen tip location, Wacom Center introduced “Pen tip to cursor alignment”. On the Pen page, select Advanced and then Pen tip to cursor alignment (at the bottom). You can adjust the alignment by dragging the blue dot, or by setting the exact pixel offset in horizontal and vertical direction (recommended).

This feature is available in Wacom Center for all pen displays (except for DTH/DTK-2200) supported by driver version 6.4.7 or later.
This setting applies to all pens on the pen display that it was set for.



Wacom is planning to discontinue the traditional pen calibration feature from Wacom Tablet Properties for future products and driver releases. If you believe this is to be a problem, please submit a ticket and explain what issue you would like to solve with pen calibration so we can provide feedback to our driver team.
