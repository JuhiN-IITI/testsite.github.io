# I am getting an error when installing the Wacom driver. How do I find the install log?

If an error occurs when trying to install the Wacom Driver, first make sure you do not have any older Wacom driver's installed (or parts of the driver) by following the manual driver removal steps found here for macOS or here for Windows OS.


If you are still unable to install the driver and you are not sure what the reason is please follow the steps below to find the install logs on your computer, and then please contact the Wacom support team by using "submit a ticket" button below.


 
Windows


The tablet driver installer writes a log at: 




C:\Users\<current user>\AppData\Local\Temp\Install.txt or %localappdata%\Temp\Install.txt



Copy the file into your ticket form, email or chat with Customer Support

Mac

Go to the Apple menu > About this Mac


Click on More info


Scroll down to  and click on System Report


Click on Software > Logs > Installer log - Go to the file by clicking on location by clicking on the link

Open the file

Type WACOM on the search box on the top right. Look for the Wacom driver install data - installer log starts with a message such as Wacom Install.pkg


Copy the content into a .txt file your email, ticket form or chat with Customer Support
