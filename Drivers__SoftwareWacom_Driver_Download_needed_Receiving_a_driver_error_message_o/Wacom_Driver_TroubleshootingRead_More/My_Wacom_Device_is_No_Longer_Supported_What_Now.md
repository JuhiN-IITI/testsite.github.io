# My Wacom Device is No Longer Supported… What Now?

Support for your Wacom device has officially ended, and it is not included in this latest driver version.

This means the device will no longer receive software updates, compatibility improvements, or technical support — and may not work as expected with future operating systems or creative applications.

Why is my device no longer supported?

At Wacom, we deeply value the creative community and the tools that help bring your ideas to life. Like many technology companies, we eventually phase out support for older devices — usually several years after they are no longer available for sale.

We make this decision carefully, for a few important reasons.

First, it allows us to focus our efforts on current and future products—so we can continue delivering the best possible pen-on-screen experience and develop new tools that meet the evolving needs of artists and creators like you.

Second, as technology rapidly changes, continuing to support older devices becomes increasingly complex. Maintaining the systems and compatibility needed is no small task, and over time, it becomes increasingly challenging and eventually no longer possible—to maintain this level of support effectively.

What does this mean for you?Software updates, compatibility improvements and technical updates will not be provided in the new driver versions

In the short term, you can roll back your driver and continue using your current Wacom device.

However, this is only a short term solution. As your OS and software are updated, you will start to notice a potentially significant downgrade in the performance of your Wacom driver. You won’t receive bug fixes or security updates.Accessories will no longer be restocked.

Accessories like pens, cables, and nibs will only be available while current supplies last. After that, we won’t be producing or restocking items for this model.Repair parts will no longer be available.

Once the remaining inventory of replacement parts is gone, we will no longer be able to offer repair services for this device.New Products

You won’t have access to new Wacom products like Wacom Bridge – a remote desktop tool specifically designed for creatives to virtually eliminate the latency common with remote connections.

 

What to do next?

Rolling back to the previous driver version is a short term fix but upgrading your Wacom device ensures you continue to get the best Wacom experience — with improved performance, full compatibility, access to the latest features, and ongoing support.

We truly appreciate your loyalty and continued creativity with Wacom.  Our dedicated support team can recommend the best option to suit your needs and connect you with your local eStore or preferred local reseller.
