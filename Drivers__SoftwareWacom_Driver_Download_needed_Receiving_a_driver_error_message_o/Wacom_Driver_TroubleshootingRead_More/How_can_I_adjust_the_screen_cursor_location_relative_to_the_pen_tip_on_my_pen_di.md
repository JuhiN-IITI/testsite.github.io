# How can I adjust the screen cursor location relative to the pen tip on my pen display?

Some users have different preferences for the screen cursor location relative to the pen tip location. To adjust that alignment, open Wacom Center, select your pen, then Advanced and “Pen tip to cursor alignment” (at the bottom). You can adjust the alignment by dragging the blue dot, or by setting the exact pixel offset in horizontal and vertical direction (recommended).

This feature is available in Wacom Center for all pen displays (except for DTH/DTK-2200) supported by driver version 6.4.7 or later.
This setting applies to all pens on the pen display that it was set for.
