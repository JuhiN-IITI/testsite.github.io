# How can I use On-Screen Controls without having to worry about unintended touch input from my hands?

On-Screen Controls behave just like physical keyboard keys. They support modifier keys, chording (combining) of multiple keys, and chording (combining) On-Screen Controls and Pen input.
To set up an OSC, open the OSC tab in Wacom Tablet Properties or the Wacom Tablet preferences pane and review the existing examples. You can edit any of them to match the settings you like to use, or create new ones. See user documentation for details.


To use an OSC, assign a pen button or physical ExpressKey or touch gesture to the OSC of your choice. Then press that button or execute that touch gesture to open the OSC.
To use an OSC like an ExpressKey, make sure to pin it after you have opened it (you can close it at any time by selecting the “x”).


To avoid unintended touch input while using an OSC, open the Touch Options tab and select “Touch disabled except for On-Screen Controls”. Note that when you toggle touch on/off now, it will toggle between all on and this option."
