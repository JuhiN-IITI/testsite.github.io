# Does Wacom have a Tablet Driver that will support Linux?

Wacom does not offer a Linux driver directly, but there is a Linux driver available for most Wacom devices at the Linux Wacom Project on Github. Many Linux distributions come with the driver pre-installed, so first try attaching your device to your Linux machine to see if it works. If it doesn’t, visit the Github repository to download drivers and get more information.
