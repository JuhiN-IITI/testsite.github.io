# What does the error "Security Settings prevented the Wacom software from posting an event" mean?

The error "Security Settings prevented the Wacom software from posting an event" appears on Mac OS where a security setting in the OS is missing. Recent Mac OS versions added many security features to keep the computer safe from applications not downloaded directly from the App store. If an app is downloaded from the internet or directly from a developer, i.e. the Wacom Driver, the OS continues to protect the Mac. These added protections require additional security settings to be adjusted.


Until these settings are accepted, the tablet functions such as the pen and touch input will not work correctly. 
Below are links to our guides to install the driver and what security settings need to be selected. Please uninstall your driver and follow the steps to fix the issue. If the issue continues after following these steps, please contact Wacom Support.
