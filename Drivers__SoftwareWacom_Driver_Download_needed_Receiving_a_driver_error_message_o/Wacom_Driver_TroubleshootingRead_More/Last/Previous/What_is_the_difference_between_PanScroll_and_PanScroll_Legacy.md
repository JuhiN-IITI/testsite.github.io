# What is the difference between Pan/Scroll and Pan/Scroll (Legacy)?

The standard Pan/Scroll function freezes the cursor in place while scrolling. This is done to avoid the cursor to move out of the active window area, causing inconsistencies when the action is being performed. This change was introduced in a previous driver version.
However, for some users, the previous behavior which didn’t freeze the cursor is preferred. After driver 6.3.39, the Pan/Scroll (Legacy) option is enabled under the Navigation options. This alternative function will not freeze the cursor when panning or scrolling. Allowing the user to keep track of the cursor position relative to the absolute position of the pen on the tablet surface. 
To find this option, please open your device’s Pen Settings, select a button then Navigation and finally Pan/Scroll (Legacy).
