# What is the ripple around my cursor in Windows and how do I turn it off?

When using a pen device, like a Wacom tablet, Windows adds an animation around the cursor when clicking. This animation is part of the Windows OS for pen devices which historically could not be turned off. However, Windows 10 update 1903 has added an option to turn this effect off. To turn off this feature, follow the steps below.

Open the Start Menu.
Type "pen settings"  and open the Windows Pen settings menu.
Uncheck the box for "Show visual effects."
