# What does the error message “There is a problem with your tablet driver” mean and how do I fix it?

This error message means a portion of the driver has been removed or become corrupt or is blocked from starting immediately on login (it might load after a few minutes).


To resolve the issue, please uninstall and reinstall the driver with the current version. Steps to uninstall and reinstall the driver can be found here.


If the issue continues, please contact Wacom Support.
