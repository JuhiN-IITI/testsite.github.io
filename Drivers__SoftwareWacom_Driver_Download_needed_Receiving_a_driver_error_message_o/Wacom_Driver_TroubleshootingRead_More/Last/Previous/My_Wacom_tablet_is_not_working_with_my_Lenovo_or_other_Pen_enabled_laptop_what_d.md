# My Wacom tablet is not working with my Lenovo or other Pen enabled laptop, what do I do?

Some users have reported compatibility problems with their Wacom driver and a Lenovo or other pen-enabled laptop. This issue can cause the pen not to have pressure, Wintab app issues and the Wacom driver to not run correctly. 


These issues can happen due to one or both of the device drivers being out of date. To resolve this issue, simply update both drivers, the pen-enabled device driver (Driver 7.6-36 or newer), and the Wacom driver (Driver 6.3.36 or newer.)
