# What is the on screen Keypad, and how do I use it?

The on screen Keypad is a Wacom touch keypad on your display or monitor that you can open from an ExpressKey, pen button or a touch gesture. Once opened, use your pen or finger to enter the numbers or commands assigned to the keys.


The Keypad contains up to 28 numbers, modifiers and keystroke commands and is fully customizable. Look for more information about using Keypads and other On-Screen Controls in the User Help for your product.
