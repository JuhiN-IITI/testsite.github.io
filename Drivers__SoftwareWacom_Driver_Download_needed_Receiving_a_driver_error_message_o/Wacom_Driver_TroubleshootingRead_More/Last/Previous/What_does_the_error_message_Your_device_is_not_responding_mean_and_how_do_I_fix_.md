# What does the error message “Your device is not responding” mean and how do I fix it?

This message will only appear with a tablet that has the touch feature. The message is caused by the touch driver not starting or a service crash.


To resolve the issue, please restart your computer. If you receive the same error message, please uninstall and reinstall the driver with the current version. If the issue continues, please contact Wacom Support.


Steps to uninstall and reinstall the driver can be found here
