# I’m not able to rename objects on Mac OS, Why?

Wacom has received reports from customers running Mac OS that they are unable to select and rename objects on the desktop using a Wacom pen. This issue has been confirmed by our driver team and they are working to resolve this issue soon.


Until a new driver is released to resolve this issue, below are other ways to rename an item.

Right click on the icon, and select rename from the context menu
Click on the icon with the pen to select it, then press the Enter key on the keyboard to rename.
If your tablet supports touch, using the touch feature tap the icon to select it, and click again to rename.
