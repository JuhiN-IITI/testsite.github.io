# What is “Touch disabled except for On-Screen Controls”? What is it good for?

This option limits touch input to the On-Screen Controls. When it is active, you can move both hands on the Cintiq Pro without having to worry about triggering unintended gestures. After opening an On-Screen Control, you can use your fingers (or pen) to select any of the functions assigned to those buttons. See FAQ for On-Screen Controls for more details. Note that ExpressKeys or touch buttons set to Touch Toggle will toggle between All Touch Enabled and this option when it is selected.
