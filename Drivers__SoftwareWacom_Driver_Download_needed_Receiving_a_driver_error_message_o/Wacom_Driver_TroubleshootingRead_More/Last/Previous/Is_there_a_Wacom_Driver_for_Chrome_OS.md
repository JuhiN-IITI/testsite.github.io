# Is there a Wacom Driver for Chrome OS?

The One by Wacom, Wacom Intuos, and Wacom One is supported by certain Chrome OS versions natively and do not need a driver to be installed to work. For more information visit our guide here. 


Chrome OS is an operating system designed by Google and uses the Google Chrome web browser as its main user interface. As a result, Chrome OS primarily supports only web applications. Due to this type of infrastructure, a driver for Wacom products is unable to be installed. 
Depending on the Chromebook you have, and the OS image provided by the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) limited pen support may be available and pen input will work with some older Wacom Tablets. Pen pressure, touch input, and the tablet Expresskeys will not work in most cases.
