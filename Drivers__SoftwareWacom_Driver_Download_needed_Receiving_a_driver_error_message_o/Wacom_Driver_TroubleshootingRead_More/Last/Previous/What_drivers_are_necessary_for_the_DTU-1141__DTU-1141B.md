# What drivers are necessary for the DTU-1141 / DTU-1141B?

For the Wacom DTU-1141 / DTU-1141B device two separate drivers are required - a pen input driver and a display driver.


For the Tablet (pen input) driver you can go: Wacom Product Resources


The DisplayLink driver (video over USB) can be downloaded directly from DisplayLink site:
http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/windows
http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/osx. 


Please note that on more recent versions of Windows 10 (Windows 10 Anniversary Update version 1607 and later) the DisplayLink driver does not need to be installed as the DTU is supported natively within Windows.
