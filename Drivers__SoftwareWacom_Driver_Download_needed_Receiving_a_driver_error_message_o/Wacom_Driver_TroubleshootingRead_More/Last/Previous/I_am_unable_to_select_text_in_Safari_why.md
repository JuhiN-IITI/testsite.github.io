# I am unable to select text in Safari, why?

In Safari 10.0+, customers have reported difficulty with quickly selecting text using their pen.  Only when dragging the pen slowly can text be selected.  Wacom has confirmed this as an issue within Safari and is in the process of informing Apple. The current workarounds are to slowly select text with your pen or use another web browser as the issue is only related to Safari.
