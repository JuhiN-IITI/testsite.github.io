# Why do I have to press so hard to get my pen to work?

You may be able to fix this by opening the Wacom Tablet Control Panel and clicking on the "Pen" tab, and setting your pen to use a lighter tip feel by moving the slider towards "soft." You can also select the "Details" button and decrease the "Sensitivity and Click Threshold" settings.
