# What are the functions “Pan/Zoom” and “Tumble” in the driver?

Pan/Zoom” and “Tumble” are two new functions that were introduced in driver version 6.3.25 in order to make working with a pen in 3D applications easier.


Pan/Zoom combines two functions on one button: 
  
In many 3D applications*, pressing the button while the pen tip is hovering will activate the Pan tool.
In many 3D applications*, pressing the button while the pen tip is touching the tablet will activate the Zoom tool when moving the pen.
In other applications*, pressing the button while the pen tip is hovering will send vertical & horizontal scroll messages. This will simulate panning in applications that support these standard Windows messages, but actual results may vary for each application.
In other applications*, pressing the button while the pen tip is touching the tablet will send Ctrl + vertical scroll messages. This will zoom in applications that support this standard Windows message, but actual results may vary for each application.
 

Tumble activates the tumble or rotate tool for many 3D applications*, and sends a Middle Click to all other applications.
