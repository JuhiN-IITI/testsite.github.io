# My On-Screen Controls (sometimes) donâ€™t work together with the pen. What is going on?

To use the pen and On-Screen Controls together, make sure your pen hand touches the pen display before your second hand or its fingers. Alternately, press the touch key while the pen is out of proximity (too far away from the display to be able to move the screen cursor) and then touch the pen to the pen display. This will be improved in a future driver release.
NOTE: The FAQ above apply for pen & touch displays only. (Cintiq Pro, MSP, older Cintiq with touch, Cintiq Companion)
