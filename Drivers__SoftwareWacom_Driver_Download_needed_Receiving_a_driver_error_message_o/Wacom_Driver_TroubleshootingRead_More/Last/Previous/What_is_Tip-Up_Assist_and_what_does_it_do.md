# What is Tip-Up Assist and what does it do?

Tip-Up Assist helps with accurately placing control points on your screen. When trying to place a crosshair or control point onto a particular pixel, many users move the crosshair to the right location. Then, when they release the pressure on the pen tip, the pen tip moves by a small amount and the final location of the crosshair is one or two pixels off from the targeted location. This patent pending feature restores the crosshairâ€™s final position to the place that the user originally targeted before their unintended tip movement. It is designed to not interfere with natural drawing strokes.
If there are any unforeseen issues at the end of strokes, this feature can be disabled as follows: Open Wacom Tablet Properties or the Wacom Tablet preferences pane, select Options, and deselect the checkbox for Tip-Up Assist.
This feature applies for the ProPen2, ProPen 3D & ProPen Slim pens.
