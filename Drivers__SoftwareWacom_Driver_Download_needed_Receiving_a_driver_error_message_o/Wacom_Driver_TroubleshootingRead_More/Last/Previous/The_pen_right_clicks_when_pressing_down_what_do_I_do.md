# The pen right clicks when pressing down, what do I do?

Windows has many pen tools built in to the operating system. Once such tool is called press and hold to right click. This feature allows a user to press down on the tablet with a pen and hold for a short time as a short cut to bring up the right click menu. As this feature can interfere when drawing, follow the steps below to turn this Windows feature off.


Open: Control Panel> Pen and Touch> and Double Click on Press and Hold.


In this new window un-check the box at the top that says enable press and hold for right clicking.


Click apply.
