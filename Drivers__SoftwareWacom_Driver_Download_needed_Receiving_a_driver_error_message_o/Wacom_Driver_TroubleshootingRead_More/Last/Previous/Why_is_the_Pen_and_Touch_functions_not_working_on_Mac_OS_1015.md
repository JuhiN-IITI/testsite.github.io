# Why is the Pen and Touch functions not working on Mac OS 10.15?

Apple updated Mac OS 10.15. Customers have reportedÂ an issue with Wacom tablets not working correctly after that update.


Mac OS 10.15. added many security features to keep the computer safe from applications not downloaded directly from the App store. If a app is downloaded from the internet or directly from a developer, i.e. the Wacom Driver, the OS continues to protect the Mac. These added protections require additional security settings to be adjusted. The settings will need to be adjusted to allow the app access to certain parts of the OS. Until these settings are accepted, the tablet functions such as pen and touch will not work correctly. Follow the steps at our 10.15 driver guide here to resolve the issue.
