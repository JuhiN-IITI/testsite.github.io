# Why is my pen calibration incorrect when I change the tablet orientation?

There are four possible tablet orientations for the Cintiq Companion Hybrid, and each one requires a separate pen calibration. The first time you change your tablet orientation, youâ€™ll be presented with a calibration screen; if you previously dismissed it before completing calibration, you can reopen it from within the Wacom Desktop Center.Please note that pen calibration in Mobile Mode is a separate function from desktop mode calibration, and will require four additional pen calibrations.
