# What if double-clicking is difficult?

Be sure you are quickly tapping the tablet twice in the same place on the tablet active area. Wacom recommends using the side switch to double-click. You can also open the Wacom Tablet Properties and navigate to the Pen tab. Try increasing the Tip Double Click Distance, or using a lighter Tip Feel.
