# Why is the screen cursor not moving in alignment with my pen?

To adjust the alignment of your screen cursor to you pen tip for a pen display (except DTH/DTK-2200), follow the instructions in How can I adjust the screen cursor location relative to the pen tip on my pen display?


For all Wacom display products, you should be able to fix this by calibrating your pen from the Wacom Tablet Control panel; you simply need to open the “Calibration” tab to perform this function on the screen.


Also, if you’ve customized the side switch on your pen to toggle between “Pen mode” and “Mouse mode,” make sure that your pen display is operating in pen mode.
