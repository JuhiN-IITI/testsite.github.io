# Why is the Wacom driver is not working with my Antivirus software?

In some rare cases, an Antivirus can cause software interference with the Wacom Driver. The software can prevent one or more of the driver processes from starting.  Depending on the severity of the interference and the tablet being used, this can result in following error messages

Supported tablet not found
Tablet driver not responding
Tablet driver not found



The error messages can occur if:

the software driver processes are running but the tablet is either not connected, unsupported or the hardware driver installation failed on the computer
the tablet driver did is not installed correctly. 



If you are able, please test by disabling your antivirus software and restarting the computer. After restart test the tablet. If the issue does not continue, open Task Manager and check to make sure all of the following are running.

WacomHost.exe
Wacom_Tablet.exe
Wacom_TabletUser.exe
Wacom_TouchUser.exe
WTabletServicePro.exe



If all of these processes are running but the issue continues, please contact Wacom Support. If all processes are running, and the tablet is working correctly, next enable your antivirus software and restart the computer. Once the computer is restarted test and see if the issue continues.
If the issue does continue, check again if all of these processes are running. If all of the processes are still running please contact Wacom Support.
If some of these processes are missing when the Antivirus software is enabled, but all of them appear when the Antivirus software is disabled, this means the program is blocking part of the Wacom Driver. Wacom would suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Antivirus software to learn how to enable these processes to run with their Antivirus software.
