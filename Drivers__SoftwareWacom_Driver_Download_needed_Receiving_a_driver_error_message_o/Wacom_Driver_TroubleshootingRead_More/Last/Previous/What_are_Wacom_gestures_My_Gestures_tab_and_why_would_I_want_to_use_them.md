# What are Wacom gestures (My Gestures tab) and why would I want to use them?

Wacom's 3, 4 and 5 finger gestures have been designed to fit specific needs of Wacom users, mainly improving their productivity. They are automatically available in Mac OS X v10.5.8 and later and in Windows 7. To turn off these capabilities in Windows select “Use Windows gestures” on the touch options tab. Download the Wacom Gesture Guide from www.wacom.com for more information.
