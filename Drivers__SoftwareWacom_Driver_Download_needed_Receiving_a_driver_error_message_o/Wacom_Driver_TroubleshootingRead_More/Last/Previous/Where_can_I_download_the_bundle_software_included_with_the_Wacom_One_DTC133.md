# Where can I download the bundle software included with the Wacom One (DTC133)?

First, download the most recent driver here.


Then plug-in your Wacom device to your computer and follow the easy set-up wizard. Once registered, you will be able to download and activate the software* that is bundled with the Wacom device you purchased.


If you are experiencing an issue following the steps, please refer to I'm having trouble registering my tablet, what do I do?
