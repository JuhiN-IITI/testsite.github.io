# I get a Yellow notepad with using the pen on Mac OS, why?

This is part of your Mac operating system, a program called ink. To turn this feature off, go to Apple>System Preferences> Ink> Turn handwriting recognition off, and uncheck the box that says “allow me to ink in any application” This will turn that feature off.
