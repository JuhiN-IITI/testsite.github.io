# Why is the pen scrolling/panning instead of drawing?

Recent Microsoft Windows updates have made large changes in the settings for Windows Ink. These changes affect all Pen and Touch devices, not just Wacom Tablets. Users have reported issues with these updates causing their pen not to act as expected in the application they are using. Some examples include scrolling instead of drawing in Photoshop or Corel Painter and not releasing a selection with the pen in Outlook or a web browser like Firefox and Chrome.




This issue has been fixed with the release of the latest Windows update 1903. To download and install this update, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and select Check online for updates from Microsoft Once the update is installed follow the steps below:

Open the Windows Start menu
Type "pen settings" and open the Windows pen settings.
Check-in "let me use my pen as a mouse in some desktop apps."
