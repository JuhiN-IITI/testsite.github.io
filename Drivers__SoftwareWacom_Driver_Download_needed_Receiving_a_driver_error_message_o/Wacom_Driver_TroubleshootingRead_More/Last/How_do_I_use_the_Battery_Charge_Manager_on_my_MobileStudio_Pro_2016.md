# How do I use the Battery Charge Manager on my MobileStudio Pro 2016

Wacom has recently added battery management control that allows you to make the most of your MobileStudio Pro’s battery health. All you need is the BIOS update and the Charge manager file found on the Wacom support page and you are ready to get started. If you’re a mobile user, the default setting is already in place and will give you maximum battery capacity. For those of you that are mainly working at a desk and have the device attached to the power outlet, we recommend you switch to the desktop mode and maximize the life of your battery. Please see the requirements and follow the directions to find the battery mode control.


This updated is available for the following models: DTHW1620H, DTHW1620M, DTHW1320H, DTHW1320M, DTHW1320L, DTHW1320T


If you are sure this applies to your device, follow the steps below: 

Make sure driver 6.3.38 or later is installed - https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers
Open the Wacom Desktop Center
Make sure there are no other firmware updates available - Do not proceed further before doing this
