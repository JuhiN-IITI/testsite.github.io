# Does Wacom support Windows 32-bit Operating Systems?

Wacom has discontinued driver updates for 32-bit versions of Windows. This affects the 32-bit versions of Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.
Wacom driver v.6.3.40 is the final driver to support 32-bit operating systems. All current (as of August 2020) Wacom pen tablet and pen display products are fully supported on those operating systems. Customers who use 32-bit versions of Windows can download the v.6.3.40 driver, now and in the future, and use them with any of the Wacom pen tablets and pen displays launched before August 2020. The drivers supporting 32-bit versions of Windows can be found on the Wacom Driver page by searching for your product and selecting the “older versions” link.
Customers who are planning to purchase a future (not yet available) Wacom product for use with a Windows computer will require a 64-bit version of Windows.
