# Setting up Using NumPad with Wacom On-Screen Shortcuts (OSS)

As of the Wacom driver 6.4.9, a change for the default settings of Numbers keys in the Keypad OSS as been made. In previous driver versions, the numbers keys defaulted to standard keyboard numbers.


From driver version 6.4.9 onward, the numbers in that OSS default to NumPad keys. That affects these keys: 





 


So from driver version 6.4.9 onwards, those keys will follow the NumLock setting of the keyboard:




If the NumLock is on (LED lit), the keys will send NumPad numbers.
If the NumLock is off, the keys will send the alternate function that is highlighted on the NumPad.



The name displayed on the OSS key is just the “#” because that is the primary use.


The key function is labeled “Num 4” to indicate that this is a NumPad key.





Customers without a physical NumPad and NumLock key on the keyboard can use the Windows On-Screen Keyboard to change the NumLock setting:

Press the Ctrl + Windows Key ⊞ + O keys at the same time to open the on-screen keyboard.
Click on Options.
Check the box next to “Turn on numeric key pad” and “OK” to enable the NumPad on the on-screen keyboard.
Select the NumLock key on the on-screen keyboard to turn NumLock on:


As long as NumLock is on (blue), the OSS Keypad keys will send numbers to the application.
Windows retains this setting through a restart.





Additionally, the Numbers Presets for the Expresskeys on the new Intuos Pro models also default to NumPad numbers.
