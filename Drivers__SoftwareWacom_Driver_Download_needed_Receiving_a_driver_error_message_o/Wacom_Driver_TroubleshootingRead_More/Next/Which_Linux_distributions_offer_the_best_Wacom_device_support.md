# Which Linux distributions offer the best Wacom device support?

Most recent Linux distributions provide full hardware support for Wacom devices. For production use, we recommend using the GNOME 40 or later desktop with one of these distributions:
• Rocky Linux 9 (Gnome 40)
• Fedora Workstation 40 (Gnome 46)
• Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 (Gnome 40)
• Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Gnome 46)
