# Pen input or touch input does not work as expected

Step 1: Do you get an error message from the Wacom Driver? 


Please see the article I'm getting an error message from the Wacom Driver - what can I do? for a list of error messages from the Wacom Driver.


If you don't see an error message, please check My pen is lagging, jumping or not responding to pressure correctly. What can I do?
Step 2: Install the latest driver


Please ensure that the latest driver from https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers is installed.
Use our getting started guides for the correct installation of the driver: https://www.wacom.com/support/getting-started

If the installation of the driver resolved the issue, your issue should be solved.
Otherwise proceed to Step 3.


 
Step 3: Ensure that the device is connected and switched on


Please check our getting started guides for the correct connection of the hardware: https://www.wacom.com/support/getting-started 

Are all device cables connected as described in the devices Getting Started page or in the device manual? 
Try to avoid wireless connection in this step.
Is the main LED lit? 



In case the main LED is not ON although all cables are connected as described, please go to Step 7. 


Otherwise proceed to Step 4. 


 
Step 4: Check your Wacom device


The steps depend on what works - and what doesn't. Please use the following articles to check if your device works as expected.

In case this does not help, please go to Step 5.


Step 5: Check the driver and restart


Open the Wacom Center and click on the Settings button on the upper right area



Scroll down to the Troubleshooting options section and click on Driver check


The driver check returns an error and recommends to restart the driver
Does this restart solve the issue?
The driver check does not find an error. 
When you chose to restart the driver nonetheless, does this restart solve the issue? 



In case the driver is showing a clear error message, please go back to Step 1 - Driver Error Messages.
If the driver is now working as expected, test it under normal working conditions, if the driver restart helped to solve the issue.
Otherwise proceed to Step 6. 


 
Step 6: Ensure a clean installation of the driver


Unless you already did this in Step 2, please uninstall and install the latest driver:

In case the driver still does not work as expected, go to Step 7.


Step 7: Configure and Calibrate


In Windows, when the touch input goes to another screen and not to the Cintiq, it can be calibrated as follows:
Windows Settings>Hardware & Sound>Tablet PC Settings>Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input> There click the Setup button next to "Configure your pen and touch displays" and follow the directions. If the calibration window does not appear on the desired screen then press Enter to toggle to the next screen, then tap the screen to select it.


Now touch should be properly calibrated to the desired screen.
