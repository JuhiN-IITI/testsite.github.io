# Troubleshooting the Wacom driver on Mac Video Series

Sometimes an error can appear when installing or using the Wacom Driver. Recent Mac OS versions added many security features to keep the computer safe from applications not downloaded directly from the App store. If an app is downloaded from the internet or directly from a developer, i.e. the Wacom Driver, the OS continues to protect the Mac. These added protections require additional security settings to be adjusted as well. Until these settings are accepted, the tablet functions such as the Pen and touch input will not work correctly. 


Here links to our written walkthroughs of uninstall and reinstalling the Wacom Driver. Below are also a video walk through series to help Troubleshoot the Wacom Driver on macOS. Please make sure to follow the videos in order.
