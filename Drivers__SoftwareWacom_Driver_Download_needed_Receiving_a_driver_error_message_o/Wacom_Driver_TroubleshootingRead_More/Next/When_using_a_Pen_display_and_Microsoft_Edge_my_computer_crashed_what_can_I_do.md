# When using a Pen display and Microsoft Edge my computer crashed, what can I do?

Wacom has received reports from customers and others that when using a pen display on Microsoft Edge, the host computer will crash and show the "blue screen of death."


While testing this issue, it was determined to be an issue with Microsoft Edge version 94. The issue happens on Wacom pen displays as well as third party pen displays like the Microsoft Surface.


While Microsoft works on a fix for this issue, a workaround was found during our testing. To stop the computer from crashing, simply turn off Windows Ink in the OS settings. (Follow the steps here.)


Note: if you disable Windows ink, some applications like Adobe Photoshop will no longer support pen pressure.
