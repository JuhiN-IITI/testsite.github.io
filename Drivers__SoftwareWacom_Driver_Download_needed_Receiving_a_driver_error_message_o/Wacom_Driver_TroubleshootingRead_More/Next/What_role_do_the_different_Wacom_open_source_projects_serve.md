# What role do the different Wacom open source projects serve?

The Linux Wacom Project consists of three major components:

The kernel driver translates hardware-specific protocols into standard input events, and is contributed directly to the Linux kernel.
The X driver is responsible for translating kernel events to the Linux windowing system, so tablets can be used with applications like Blender, Maya, and GIMP.
The libwacom library provides applications with more information about attached Wacom devices, allowing fully-featured control panels with relevant options and better default settings.
