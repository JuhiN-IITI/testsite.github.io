# What does the error message “A Wacom device was found that is not supported by this driver” mean and how do I fix it?

The error message “A Wacom device was found that is not supported by this driver” is shown when the Wacom Tablet Properties are opened and a Wacom Device is found that is not supported by the current driver.


There are two scenarios that will produce this error:

A Wacom device is connected to the computer that is newer than what the current installed driver supports.
A Tablet PC with an internal Wacom device that is not supported by this driver.

Examples of this would be a Lenovo, HP, or Dell computer that has Wacom Digitizer for pen or pen & touch input.





To solve this, simply install the latest driver version for your Wacom device from the Wacom drivers page: https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers. 


In case the latest driver does not help to solve this issue: 
You should be able to close the message and keep on working as the message will then only affect an internal component of your computer. In this case, please contact Wacom Support and attach the MSInfo file from your computer to your request for us to look into the issue for you.
