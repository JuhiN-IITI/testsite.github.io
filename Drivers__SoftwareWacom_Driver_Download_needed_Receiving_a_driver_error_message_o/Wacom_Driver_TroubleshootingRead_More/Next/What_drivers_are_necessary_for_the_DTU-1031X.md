# What drivers are necessary for the DTU-1031X?

There are two drivers for the DTU-1031X. One is the Wacom tablet driver for the pen digitizer. The other is a video-over-USB (MCT) driver since the DTU-1031X uses USB to transmit the video signal instead of using a separate video card and cable.


The pen tablet driver and the very latest video-over-USB (MCT) driver are available here on this page:
