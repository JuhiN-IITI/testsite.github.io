# How will I know if Wacom changes the Wacom Experience Program for Tablet Driver and collects different data in the future?

Wacom is committed to your privacy, and to collecting only the necessary data through this program. As a policy, you will be asked to opt-in to the Wacom Experience Program for Tablet Driver every time you install a new driver version. That gives you the opportunity to review the Tablet Driver Privacy Notice for each driver version before opting in. Any future program changes that result in collecting different types of data will always be accompanied by an update of the Tablet Driver Privacy Notice.


You can review the Tablet Driver Privacy Notice for your driver at any time by going to the Wacom Desktop Center and selecting More – Privacy Notice.


You can change your participation in the program at any time by going to the Wacom Desktop Center and selecting More – Wacom Experience Program. Then check or uncheck the checkbox according to your preference and click OK.
