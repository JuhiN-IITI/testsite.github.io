# What is the Wacom Experience Program?

The Wacom Experience Program is an ongoing program with the goal of using customer insights to improve our products. One part of the Wacom Experience Program is the Wacom Experience Program for Tablet Driver, which is entirely optional, and collects minimal anonymous, aggregated information on Wacom Tablet Driver use.


After installing or updating to a new Wacom driver, the driver will offer the option to participate in the Wacom Experience Program for Tablet Driver.

To participate, simply check the checkbox on the opt-in dialog and click ok.
To not participate, leave the checkbox unchecked before you click ok.
To change your participation at any time, open the Wacom Desktop Center, select More and Wacom Experience Center, then adjust the checkbox to the desired setting and click OK.



Participation in this program does not affect the performance of the driver or Wacom product in any way.


When participating in the program, the Wacom Tablet driver will automatically send certain usage and diagnostic data to Wacom for analysis purposes. The data helps us to improve the tablet driver, understand how our customer use our products, and optimize the functions and performance of the tablet driver and products for our customers.


When not participating in the program, the Wacom Tablet driver will not send data to Wacom.


(Note: All previous versions of the Wacom Experience Program (driver version 6.3.38 and earlier) have been discontinued. Wacom neither collects nor stores any data from those drivers.)
