# What drivers are necessary for the DTU-1031?

There are two drivers necessary depending on your Windows version:

A DisplayLink driver to enable the device to operate as an external monitor
A Wacom driver to enable the pen to operate properly.



On more recent versions of Windows 10 (Windows 10 Anniversary Update version 1607 and later) the DisplayLink driver does not need to be installed as the DTU is supported natively within Windows


Drivers, Quick Start Guides & Manuals are available here on this page:


Wacom Product Resources


On the Product Resources page just enter the product code into the search field and select your model from the drop down list.

Note: The DTU-1031 is a legacy model. Successor model is the DTU-1031X
