# I want to report a driver bug. How do I collect Wacom driver logs?

Collecting driver logs can help Wacom Support identify issues with the tablet driver or your operating system. For more info on what information is collected, click here. 


NOTE: The following instructions work for Mac OS and Windows with Wacom Driver 6.4.0 or later.

Open the Wacom Center
Click on the Settings button on the upper right corner

Scroll down to the Troubleshooting Section and turn ON the Driver logging

Next, use your Wacom Device normally and try to reproduce the issue.
Once the issue you want to capture occurs, open the Wacom Center and click on the Settings button again
Scroll down and click on Package log files

A context window will appear - Please do not perform any action until the process is over

Once the files are gathered a confirmation message will appear and a WacomLogs.waczip file will be placed on the Desktop
Note: At this point, Driver logging can be turned Off by following the same process as above.

Copy the file into your ticket form, email or chat with Customer Support
