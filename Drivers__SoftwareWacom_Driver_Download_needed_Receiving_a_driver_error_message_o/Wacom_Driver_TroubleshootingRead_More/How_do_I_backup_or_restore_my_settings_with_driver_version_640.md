# How do I backup or restore my settings with driver version 6.4.0?

The backup and restore user settings were removed from the Wacom Center due to a bug in the UI in earlier versions. This has been restored within the 6.4.3-1 release.  

The Cloud Services for Backup and Restore with the 6.4.0 Driver Release has been discontinued.

You can locally back up your settings by following the steps below:

In this app, you can backup and restore your settings locally.

Select "Local Disk (C:)
Open Program Files
Open Tablet
Open Wacom
Open the "PrefUtil" app
In this app you can backup and restore your settings locally.



Driver version 6.4.0 does not currently support Wacom Cloud backup support. Please back up your settings locally by following the steps above.
