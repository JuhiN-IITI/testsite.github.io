# Can I use Wacom Bridge with MS Teams, ZOOM, or Cisco Webex clients to demonstrate or teach others far way?

Yes, remote sessions are just local application windows and can be shared with meeting software like any other application. Note that this will approximately double the system requirements for bandwidth and local graphics processing, so you will need high bandwidth and a fast graphics processor or your system will slow down and lag.
