# Do Wacom Driver updates affect my virtualization software?

Once the Wacom driver is installed from www.wacom.com/drivers, driver updates can be installed from Wacom Center and will continue to support Wacom Bridge (it is essential to update both the local and remote systems). If you ever uninstall the Wacom driver, you will need to download and install the latest driver from www.wacom.com/drivers in order to reconnect Wacom Bridge.
