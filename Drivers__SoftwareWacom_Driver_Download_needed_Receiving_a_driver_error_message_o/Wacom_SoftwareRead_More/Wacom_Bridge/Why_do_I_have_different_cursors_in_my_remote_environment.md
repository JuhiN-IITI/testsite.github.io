# Why do I have different cursors in my remote environment?

Wacom Bridge optionally draws a local screen cursor on the local system, independent of the screen cursor on the remote system. The Local screen cursor and Wacom Inkline are not affected by the connection speed to the remote system, and give users with low speed connections confidence that the stroke was recorded and sent to the remote Windows system. Wacom Bridge defaults to “Show local screen cursor” thus resulting in two cursors.


Depending on the virtualization system, it may be possible to turn off the remote cursor in the client software. Which cursor is the best to use depends a lot on the speed of your connection and system, what type of Wacom product you are using, and your personal preference.


a. With high speed connections (< 30 ms ping time), try turning off the Local screen cursor from within Wacom Center’s Wacom Bridge tab.


b. With low speed (> 30 ms ping time) connections, leave the Local screen cursor on and turn off the Remote Cursor. If running Splashtop, go to View Options menu (eyeball icon).


c. With high speed connections / high performance systems and Wacom Cintiq Pro Pen displays, you may choose to turn off both cursors for a cleaner screen appearance.
