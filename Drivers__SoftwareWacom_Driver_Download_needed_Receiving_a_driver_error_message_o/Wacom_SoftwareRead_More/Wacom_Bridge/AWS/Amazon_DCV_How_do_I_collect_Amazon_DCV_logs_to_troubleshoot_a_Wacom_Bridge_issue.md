# Amazon DCV: How do I collect Amazon DCV logs to troubleshoot a Wacom Bridge issue?

In cases where issues cannot be solved easily, the Wacom and AWS teams may need to diagnose the issue and determine possible troubleshooting steps for the issue. To provide them with up-to-date information, AWS debug logs collected by following the AWS guidelines (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/troubleshooting-logs.html).


Wacom logging must be enabled from the “Gear” icon in Wacom Center, from which there is also the ability to “Package log files” in the “Troubleshooting options” section of the same page. Be sure to reproduce any problems after enabling logging and before packaging the log files.
