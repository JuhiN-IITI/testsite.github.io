# Can I use Windows Ink and Wintab applications with Wacom Bridge?

Wacom Bridge supports both Wintab and Windows Ink, remotely and locally with Windows Client.
In case of Mac OS client Wintab and Windows Ink work only in the remote environment (Windows).
Turning off Windows Ink locally disables Windows Ink with the pen remotely, as well. If some applications require Windows Ink, add them as an application specific program locally and turn on Windows Ink only for those applications.
