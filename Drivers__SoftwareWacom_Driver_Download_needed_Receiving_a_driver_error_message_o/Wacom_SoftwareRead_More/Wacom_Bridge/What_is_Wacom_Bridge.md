# What is Wacom Bridge?

Wacom Bridge is a driver-to-driver connection for subscribers using a Wacom pen tablet or pen display, for full Wacom driver support on both the local and remote computers. With Wacom Bridge, artists always have full use of their professional Wacom products, and switching between using the pen on the local and remote system is seamless and as easy as selecting the window to work in. Wacom Bridge supports Windows Ink and Wintab on the local and remote system without the need for USB redirection. All tablet settings including application specific settings apply for both the local and remote system, in windowed, full screen or multi-screen environments.
