# Wacom Bridge: How long should my Wacom Inkline “Fade time” be?

With fast connections (ping times under 20-30 ms) and faster systems, many artists find the Wacom Inkline unnecessary and turn it off. For higher ping times or slower systems, aim to set the fade time so that the Wacom Inkline shows long enough until the remote system is drawing the final line at the end of the Wacom Inkline (so they appear as a connected line).
