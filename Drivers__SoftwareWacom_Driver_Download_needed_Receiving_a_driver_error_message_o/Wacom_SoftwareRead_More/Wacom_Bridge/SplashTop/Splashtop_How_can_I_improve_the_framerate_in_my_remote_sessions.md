# Splashtop: How can I improve the framerate in my remote sessions?

a. Selecting FPS: Ultra High from the Splashtop View Options menu will provide the fastest framerate available for your connection.


b. Choosing Best Speed from the View Options menu will optimize for performance over quality video compression.


c. Verify that the remote system is using GPU Hardware acceleration (in the Performance Status window â€“ see https://support-splashtopbusiness.splashtop.com/hc/en-us/articles/6193537936027-Performance-Options). If not, disconnect and reconnect to your remote system.
