# Splashtop: How can I turn off the remote cursor?

The Splashtop software has the ability of showing or hiding the remote cursor from the Splashtop View Options menu (eyeball icon). Which cursor is the best to use depends a lot on the speed of your connection and system, what type of Wacom product you are using, and your personal preference.


a. With high speed connections (< 30 ms ping time), try turning off the Local screen cursor from within Wacom Centerâ€™s Wacom Bridge tab, and leave the Remote Cursor in Splashtop enabled.


b. With low speed (> 30 ms ping time) connections, leave the Local screen cursor on and turn off the Remote Cursor, from the Splashtop View Options menu (eyeball icon).


c. With high speed connections / high performance systems and Wacom Cintiq Pro Pen displays, you may choose to turn both cursors off for a cleaner screen appearance.
