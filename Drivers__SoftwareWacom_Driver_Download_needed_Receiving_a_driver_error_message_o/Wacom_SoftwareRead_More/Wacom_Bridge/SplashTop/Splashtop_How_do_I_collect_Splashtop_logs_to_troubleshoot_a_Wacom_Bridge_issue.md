# Splashtop: How do I collect Splashtop logs to troubleshoot a Wacom Bridge issue?

In cases where issues cannot be solved easily, the Wacom and Splashtop teams may need to diagnose the issue and determine possible troubleshooting steps for the issue. To provide them with up-to-date information, Splashtop debug logs can be sent from both the Client app and the Streamer. Follow these instructions on the Splashtop website to do so: https://support-splashtopbusiness.splashtop.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053615371-How-do-I-send-Debug-Logs.
