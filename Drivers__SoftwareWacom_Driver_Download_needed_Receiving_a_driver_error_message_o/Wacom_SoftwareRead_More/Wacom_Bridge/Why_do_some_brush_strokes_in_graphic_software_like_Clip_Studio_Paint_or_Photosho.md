# Why do some brush strokes in graphic software (like Clip Studio Paint or Photoshop) not appear in the same location as the Wacom Inkline?

Several graphic applications have brush settings that default to high line “Stabilization” or “Smoothing” values. This can cause the brush strokes to clip corners or over-tighten curves when using Wacom Bridge. Reducing the “Stabilization” or “Smoothing” settings of the selected brushes usually resolves the misalignment.
