# How do I improve the performance of my remote system?

The drawing speed when working remotely depends on many factors, most importantly on a high-speed connection to the remote computer. Other factors to consider for improving the system speed:


a. Most graphic applications are dependent on discreet graphics adapters from NVIDIA and AMD for performance on the remote system. Make sure the graphics card drivers are


up-to-date and the remote Server or Streamer software is set up to use hardware acceleration.


b. Choosing Best speed or Best responsiveness in your Client’s remote session options rather than best quality will optimize for performance over quality video compression. Check “How can I improve the framerate in my remote sessions?” for your system.


c. Higher frame rates will also be more easily achieved if the local computer has a better graphics card, although the local graphics card does not need to be as powerful unless multiple high-resolution displays are being used locally.


d. Lower display resolutions will result in a faster performance than higher display resolutions.


e. When using remote machines without a connected display, it can help to install a high-speed headless display dongle on the remote system.
