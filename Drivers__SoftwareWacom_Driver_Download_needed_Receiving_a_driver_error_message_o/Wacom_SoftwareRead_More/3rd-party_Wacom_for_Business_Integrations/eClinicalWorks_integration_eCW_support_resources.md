# eClinicalWorks integration (eCW) support resources

eCW has written and tested an interface to specifically selected Wacom signature devices.


In order for the integration to work the end-customer site will need to install the corresponding eCW eCliniForms module. The configuration of the Wacom Business Solutions product with eClinicalWorks will require assistance from the eCW support team to make sure the proper module is set up, so be sure to consult with those resources. The Wacom Business Solutions team can provide contact information if needed, open a ticket and we can assist further here.


If virtualization is involved those settings need to be considered as well.


Our Wacom Customer Care team and Business Solutions teams can assist further as needed.


As of this writing (July 2024) the following devices are compatible with eCW: STU-430, STU-540 and DTU-1141B.
