# What is the major application update for Wacom Inkspace and Bamboo Paper?

In order to provide better and more reliable services, Wacom has performed many improvements and performance optimization to the cloud infrastructure. User content will be optimized to work with the new improvements on our infrastructure.


 


How does the update work on the application?


Bamboo Paper: Users will be presented with a notification window inside the application to understand that improvements are being performed on infrastructure side. When users click to proceed, they will see a window showing the progress of the optimizations that are being applied. Users will not be able to use the application until this process is completed in several seconds. Once finalized, users can continue to use their application as usual.


Inkspace: Once users update their application and login in with their Wacom ID, they will see a window showing the progress of the optimizations that are being applied. Users will not be able to use the application until this process is completed in several seconds. Once finalized, users can continue to use their application as usual.


 


When is Wacom going to shut down the old Cloud Services?


October 31st, 2022


 


What happens if a user is not updating before or on October 31st?


User can use the Bamboo Paper and Inkspace mobile app as usual on the local device and access all content stored locally – the user will not be able to access the content stored in the cloud from within the app. Nevertheless, the user will have the opportunity to download the contents from a download link containing user’s content (as pdf file).


Download link: https://inkspace.wacom.com/data-download (login required)


 


Will a user be able to migrate the content from old to new cloud service after shutting down?


No. It is only possible to migrate content from old to new cloud service by updating the software before and on October 31st, 2022.


 


Will a user be able to still use their outdated Bamboo Paper and Inkspace mobile app?


Yes. Old apps will still function on devices, but cloud related services will no longer be active.


 


Will a user be able to access old content in the cloud?


Yes.  Old content will be backuped in pdf-file format and will be migrated to the new cloud forcibly, and available from https://inkspace.wacom.com/data-download for at least 3 years starting from forced migration date (October 31st, 2022).  Users who did not update their applications on or before October 31st, 2022 can access their backup content there. The content is available in .pdf format and the users cannot import it back in their applications or upload it in the new cloud.


 


Is Wacom ID required in the future?


Yes. Wacom ID was required by these users to use Cloud Services.  Wacom ID remains required to access and download abandoned content.
