# Downloading and Launching Inkspace

Inkspace is an application for mobile devices and desktop computers. Enabling Wacom tablets and devices that record paper drawings like the Bamboo Spark, Folio, Slate, and the new Intuos pro and Intuos pro paper. With the paper accessory kit, Inkspace is available for free from the wacom desktop center.


By selecting a device on the left under software, select "install wacom Inkspace app." The first time Inkspace launches, select "let's get started."


First it will ask to connect the device, confirm the Intuos pro tablet is plugged in, then choose the orientation of the tablet used most frequently for drawing offline or on paper.


Select "Next", choose "login/signup" to login to Inkspace or create a new Inkspace account.


When logged into an Inkspace account, any drawing synced to Inkspace will instantly be available to any device that has the Inkspace app and is logged into the same account. The guide then illustrates how to properly attach the clip.


Initiate paper drawing by touching the ink pen to the paper. Finish a drawing button by pressing the plus button, and it will sync to the Inkspace app in a few moments. Inkspace frequently checks for finished drawings while the Intuos pro is connected and sketches will appear in the Inkspace library on the left.
