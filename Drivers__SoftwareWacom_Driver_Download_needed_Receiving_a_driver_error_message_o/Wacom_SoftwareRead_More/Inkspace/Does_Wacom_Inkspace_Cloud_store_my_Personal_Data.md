# Does Wacom Inkspace Cloud store my Personal Data?

Wacom’s Inkspace Cloud does not have access to, or store  your personal Data.  The only information in Wacom’s Inkspace Cloud is the content you create and save in your Wacom Apps such as Bamboo Paper, the Inkspace App, Inkspace.com and Wacom Ink Collaboration.
