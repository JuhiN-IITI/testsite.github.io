# Notice of change to Wacom Ink Note support coming late 2022

Wacom will be removing the Synchronization (“Upload to Cloud”) service between the Wacom Ink Note application and Inkspace. This feature will be removed and no longer be supported  in late 2022. To store and save your content from the Ink Note application, use the “Export to PDF” feature within Ink Note.
