# Why aren't my files in the Inkspace Desktop App syncing with the Inkspace Cloud (Mac and Windows)?

With recent updates, we have set the App to maintenance mode indefinitely. This means that the files transferred to your Inkspace Desktop App and / or the files created with Live mode, will not sync with the cloud service and will not be available through the cloud service. 


However, the Wacom ID login will still be enabled which means the export features that rely on the cloud services will still work - ie: Export as Text, Export as PSD, Export as SVG, etc. 


You can also use the Export as Inkspace Desktop option to store your files locally. 


Note that file syncing with the cloud is still available with the Inkspace Mobile App (Android and iOS).
