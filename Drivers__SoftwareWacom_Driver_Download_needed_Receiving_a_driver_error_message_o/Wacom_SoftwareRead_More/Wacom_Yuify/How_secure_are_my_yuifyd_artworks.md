# How secure are my yuify'd artworks?

A permanent record of your export event is created which acts as proof of your first registration and has supportive data that helps you establish your record as the creator. Since these records are permanent and non-mutable, these act as solid records of your content linked to your authorship. Similarly license agreements are also recorded and can be securely retrieved.
