# Do I need a Wacom ID to use Yuify?

Yes, some applications you need a Wacom ID to log in directly to Yuify and secure your artwork (e.g. Photoshop). In other applications (e.g. Clip Studio Paint and Reblle) you can start using Yuify without a wacom ID but you will need one later when you want to manage your secured records.
