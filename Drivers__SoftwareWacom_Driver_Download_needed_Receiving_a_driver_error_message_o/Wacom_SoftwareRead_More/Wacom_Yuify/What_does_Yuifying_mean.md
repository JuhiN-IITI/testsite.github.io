# What does Yuifying mean?

Yuifying or micro-marking is the process of securing your artwork with Yuify. It involves using Yuify tool in your creative application to securely export your content, that injects invisible pixels into the export file format of your photo or digital artwork. It is a proprietary technology developed and patented by Wacom.


The image quality stays the same while Wacom Yuify creates a link between you as an artist and your own artwork along with a permanent record. This enables you to start creating projects out of your export records for which you can assign licenses and sign agreements and manage your digital rights.
