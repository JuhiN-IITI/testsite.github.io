# What does Yuifinder mean?

Yuifinder is a tool built within the Yuify app but also availble to other applications/platforms to inspect the secured record of the artwork. Just drag and drop an artwork in yuifinder to find if it has a Yuify record and if so, from whom.


The app gives users and authors the ability to reach out, negotiate and agree on authorization of artwork use with or without payment. License contracts are enforceable and artworks are secured against unauthorized use.
