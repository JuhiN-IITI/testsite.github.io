# How robust is the Yuify micro-mark against changes on the artwork?

Yuify embeds a digital ID into the artwork to preserve the identity of the image and thus the technology is being built to be resilient. We will continue working on preserving the digital ID so preserve the record of creation with the artwork against manipulations to the image itself.
