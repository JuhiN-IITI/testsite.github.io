# What personal information do I need to provide to prove my identity to open a Yuify account?

You only need the information provided with your Wacom ID information to use the Yuify Application (Name, email). 


Only when you want to create a legally binding contract using the Yuify service, an address needs to be provided which will be included in the contract to make it legally robust for most legal institutions.
