# How can I access Wacom Yuify?

If you are located in an EU country, in UK, Norway, Switzerland or the USA you can just go to https://yuify.com/learn-more and watch the videos or follow the instructions how to get started.



If you don't have a Wacom ID yet, please Sign up for it.





Once the Wacom ID is set up, you can use your Wacon ID credentials to Log in to the Yuify Web Application -> https://app.yuify.com/login


Connect at least one of the available softwares under Settings->Connect Application and you ready to start.


If you are located in a country other than those listed above, we are unfortunately unable to offer the Yuify service to you.
