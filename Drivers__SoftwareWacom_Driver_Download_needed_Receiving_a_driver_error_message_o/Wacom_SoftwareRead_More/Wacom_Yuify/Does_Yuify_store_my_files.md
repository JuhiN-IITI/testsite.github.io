# Does Yuify store my files?

No, Yuify does not store your files.


Yuify only keeps a record of the export of the file to prove the creation of the content. The export image with the digital ID is saved where you specify during the secured export process. Yuify only retains a small image (thumbnail) of your export file that is used as a visual identifier for the export record.
