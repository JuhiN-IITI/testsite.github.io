# I forgot to push the ‘Page’ button and now my pages are overlapping. Can I separate the pages afterwards?

Yes, in the Wacom Inkspace app you can use the ‘split’ feature to separate your notes into different pages.


For iOS:

Open the page you want to split.
Press the ‘edit’ button then select ‘split.’
Use the time line slider at the bottom of the page to select the point where the note should be separated.
Press the ‘split’ button at the top to confirm.
When you return to your library you will see that your pages have been split.



For Android:

Open the page you want to split.
Press the menu button in the top right-hand corner then select ‘Split Page’.
Use the time line slider at the bottom of the page to select the point where the note should be separated.
Press the menu button again and select ‘Create Note.’
When you return to your library you will see that your pages have been split.
