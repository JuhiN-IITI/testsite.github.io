# Does sign I pro PDF 1.1.6 allow me to save PDF documents under the original document name?

At this time, the application doesn’t allow you to automatically save a PDF document under its original document name: when you create a PDF by printing named documents from your application to the sign Ι pro PDF printer driver, they will appear as new, unnamed documents. There is a workaround, however, which you can access by installing a free PDF printer that supports automatic file naming, enabling you to open the relevant PDF document directly after printing. After installation, you simply need to set the sign I pro PDF as the default software to open PDF files to create documents with the desired file names.
