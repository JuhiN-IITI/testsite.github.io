# How can I easily sign documents on my Windows PC?

Wacom has signature pads and pen displays can be used to capture signatures on documents when utilizing any supported third party eSignature software. In addition, Wacom has a software solution called sign pro PDF that creates a PDF copy of a document and allows signatures and mark-ups to be added to the document. It also has a built-in print-to-PDF functionality (Windows) so you can sign from any application. Other applications from our partners can also be used with our signature devices. You can find an overview of the software here: https://marketplace.wacom.com/apps/1236/sign-pro-pdf-for-windows#!overview sign pro PDF is free to try for 30 days. After that you can sign up for a monthly or annual subscription to continue to use the software.
