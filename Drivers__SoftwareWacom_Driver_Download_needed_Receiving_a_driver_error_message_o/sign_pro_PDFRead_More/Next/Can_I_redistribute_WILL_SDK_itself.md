# Can I redistribute WILL SDK itself?

No, WILL's regular evaluation and commercial licenses do not include the option for redistribution of the SDK. Please contact your Wacom WILLTM partner manager or fill out our “Contact Sales” form on developer.wacom.com if you have any questions or plans regarding redistribution of WILLTM SDK or products that contain WILLTM technology.
