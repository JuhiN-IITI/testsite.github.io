# How can I verify if a document signature is valid?

When viewing signed documents in sign | pro PDF, the validity of individual signatures is indicated by the following color-coded icons:

Green check mark: No changes were made to the document after it was signed
Yellow check mark: An allowed change (other than signing) was made after the document was signed, but subsequent revisions have not been signed
Red cross: Disallowed changes were made to the document after it was signed. This type of change will usually invalidate all signatures in a document
