# How do I sign on sign pro PDF for Windows in multiple locations if there are multiple keywords or multiple occurrences of a keyword in the PDF document?

For a given document you can position signature by keyword only once - remaining signatures will have to be manually placed using the mouse. If you have multiple occurrences of the same keyword you can specify which occurrence you want to position your signature against by changing the settings under Options -> Signature Area. However, you can only use keyword positioning just once for a document.
