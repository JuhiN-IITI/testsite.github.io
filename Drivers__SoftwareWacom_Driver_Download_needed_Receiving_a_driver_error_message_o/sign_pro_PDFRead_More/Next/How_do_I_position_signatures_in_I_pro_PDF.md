# How do I position signatures in I pro PDF?

The application offers two methods to position signature areas: click and drag signatures with your mouse (default option), or position the first (additional) signature by key word. For this method, simply open the "Options" dialog box, select "Position signature by keyword," then choose a keyword for your search, and confirm the size and position of the signature area relative to the keyword.
