# Can I use my files in Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs, or iPhoto?

Yes, your notes can be easily exported as JPG, PDF or WILL (Wacom Ink Language Layer) files to most any workspace or service that accepts these file formats including Dropbox, Evernote, Google Drive and iPhoto. Once exported, you can access files directly or share via email.
