# What should I do if I suspect my sign I pro PDF has a virus?

If you received a virus warning that caused your installation to fail, please be assured that this is a false alarm. Wacom has stringent security standards, and we would never sell infected software. We’ve previously seen this problem with Avira Antivirus, and we’re working with them on a solution. It is possible to install sign | pro PDF with the virus scanner deactivated; upon completion, simply add a handling exception for the affected file to the virus scanner to avoid further alarms. If you receive a similar false alarm notification from any other virus scanner software, please click Contact Us below.
