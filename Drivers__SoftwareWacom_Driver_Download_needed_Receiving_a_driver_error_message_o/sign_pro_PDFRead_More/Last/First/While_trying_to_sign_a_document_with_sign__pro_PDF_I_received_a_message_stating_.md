# While trying to sign a document with sign | pro PDF, I received a message stating that no signature device is connected. How can I fix this?

This problem is exclusive to users of Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 2013. Unfortunately, Office 2013 has a compatibility issue with the STU-Tablet, causing Word to keep the application locked when a document is created in Word 2013 and then printed to sign | pro PDF. It’s not currently possible to sign documents while any Office 2013 apps are open; you simply need to close any associated programs before printing. We have contacted Microsoft, and hope that this problem will be fixed.
