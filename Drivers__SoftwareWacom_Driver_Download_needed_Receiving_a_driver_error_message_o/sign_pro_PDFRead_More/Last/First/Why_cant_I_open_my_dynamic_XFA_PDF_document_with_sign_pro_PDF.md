# Why can't I open my dynamic (XFA) PDF document with sign pro PDF?

This is because an XFA (dynamic) PDF is not a standard PDF Acroform. Due to the manner in which Adobe locks XFA forms they cannot be displayed by most viewing applications, including sign pro. The only viewers that we are aware of that can reliably display these forms are Adobeâ€™s own products, although some Foxit PDF viewers appear to be XFA-enabled.
