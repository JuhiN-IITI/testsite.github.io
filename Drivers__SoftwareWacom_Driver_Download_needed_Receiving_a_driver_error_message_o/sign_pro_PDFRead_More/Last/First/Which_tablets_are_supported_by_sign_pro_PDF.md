# Which tablets are supported by sign |pro PDF?

The application works with all current Wacom tablets: STU-series signature tablets, Bamboo, Intuos, Cintiq interactive pen displays and PL/DTU-series pen displays. Versions older than 1.1.6 only work with STU-series signature tablets. Please note: Bamboo, Intuos, Cintiq and PL-series tablets require driver software. Some older tablets may also require a driver, which, as a result of the age of the product, is not available for the latest Windows versions. Please visit the download page on the Wacom website in your region for further details on the availability of driver software for your tablet.
