# Why am I asked to enter a password every time I open sign | pro PDF 1.1.6?

The first time you run the application it will ask if youâ€™d like a certificate to be created and automatically selected for you. If this is your preference, select "Copy key and password to Windows Certificate Store" in the "New Key" dialog box, and the password will be added to your personal key store. Once this is set up, you will no longer be required to enter a password each time you open the application.
