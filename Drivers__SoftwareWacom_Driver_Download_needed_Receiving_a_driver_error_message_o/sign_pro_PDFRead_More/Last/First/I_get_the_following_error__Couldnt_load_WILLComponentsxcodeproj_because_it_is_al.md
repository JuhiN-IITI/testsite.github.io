# I get the following error:  "Couldn't load WILLComponents.xcodeproj because it is already opened from another project or workspace"

This happens when you open the Creativity and Productivity Demo simultaneously. It is caused by the fact that both demos share the WILLComponents.xcodeproj as a sub-project. The solution is to close both demo projects and then to have only one of them open at a time.
