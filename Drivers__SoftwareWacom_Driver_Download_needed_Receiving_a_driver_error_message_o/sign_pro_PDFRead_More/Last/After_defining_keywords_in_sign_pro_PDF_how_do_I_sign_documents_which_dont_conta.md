# After defining keywords in sign pro PDF how do I sign documents which don't contain any of those keywords?

If the specified keyword is not present in the document, then it will not be possible to sign. However, you can change your settings by navigating to Options >> Signature Area, and selecting the radio button against "Position signature with mouse". This will then enable you to sign on that document.
