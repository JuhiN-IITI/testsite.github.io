# Why do I get a blank screen when starting up sign pro PDF for Windows?

If sign pro PDF for Windows presents a blank start-up screen, please make sure that Windows Update is up-to-date and the latest version of IE is installed - this should fix it. If not please contact Wacom sign pro PDF support signpro-support@wacom.com
